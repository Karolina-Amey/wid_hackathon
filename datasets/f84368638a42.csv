I'm really upset, like hyperventilating crying upset, and the only thing that I feel will make it better is to hurt myself. This is something I haven't done in years, and not a soul knows I've done it in the past (very creative with hiding cuts in the creases of limbs etc.). I'm absolutely not going to hurt myself tonight. My 15 yr old girl is upstairs in her room, she's number one in the list of priorities and thus would never do it under the same roof as her, but she goes to her dad's for the night tomorrow and I'm planning on doing it then. It gives me a sense of control when everything else is going crazy. My ""D""H has broken me, again. He cheated on me in 2013, he gaslit me for years, even when I was begging him for the truth, until I found out for sure in 2018. I stayed, we ""recovered"", he did so much to regain my trust. Or so I thought. We own a small business (well smallish, we employ 25 people). I am a director. I was supposed to be an active partner, we argued over the years as I was consistently left on the periphery, I didn't have access to the finances for years, he always gave me an excuse as to why I didn't have replacement bank access details when mine stopped working pre Covid. I regularly asked him how we were doing financially, he sad ""not bad"", ""pretty good"", I checked with him that major creditors had been paid, that pensions had been paid into (they have, I've now checked), every time I knew account submissions to companies house were due I would get assurance after assurance that it was all in hand. Every time there was a letter through our door saying the accounts were late, there was always a reason, always assurances that our accountant was taking care of it. I am a fucking IDIOT for believing him. If I'm honest, I never felt 100% sure deep down. I got myself another job last November, which I love and I've been very successful in so far - it gives me purpose, it gives me a renewed sense of identity and self worth. Thank god for this job. The shit hit the fan on Thursday when our business partner (owns a very small percentage of the business, he's a silent partner for all intents and purposes but listed as a director) got a call from the bank to say that the ltd company had been struck off due to not filing any accounts (even the extension deadline had been exhausted), and that our bounce back loan of circa 22k and the overdraft that he had managed to run up since the last accounts were filed of 20k were both immediately due in full. After all my pleas for involvement, information, offers of help and support ad infinitum (even after I started the new job), reassurances from him that all is well, we are now in a position that we may well have to sell our house to pay the debt, and shut a business down that has been running since the 80s (we took it over in 2013). I checked companies house, they have issued no less than 5 compulsory strike-off notices since 2020. I am livid with myself. Covid hit us hard, but that doesn't explain why accounts were submitted late, or not at all in this case. He's submitted a plea in writing to have a final chance to submit the accounts and he's meeting the accountant on Monday (it isn't her fault, she's been sending him emails asking for more information that he's just been ignoring), when they'll complete and file them if they can - in the vain hope that this will appease the Companies House gods. He is saying all the right things, ""I've fucked up, you deserve better"" etc. he is telling me he has been depressed for a while, and I know depression takes many forms but all I've see him do over the past year is having fun with his mates, playing in his band, spending inordinate amounts of time on frivolous projects - which I thought he was doing as he was on top of the business stuff. He's been working from home about 90% of the time since Covid (I don't work from home), but unless I ask him to do something specific in the house it usually doesn't get done. Often the breakfast stuff is still on the table when I get home. Our lovely house is currently a shithole - it doesn't help that I'm currently anaemic so when I get home I am dog tired and can only just about make dinner - admittedly he does cook sometimes, and clears up if he doesn't cook, he's pretty good with the kitchen stuff. He has had some shit thrown at him this year by life - he was very ill a few months ago and was hospitalised, which put him out for about a month, his estranged father died (complex grief is a thing, of that I'm sure). He has every reason to be depressed. But he's lied and he's lied and he's lied. He's jeopardised us, our house, the livelihoods of 25 people, our friend/business partner and his family (who are godparents to my DD, as I am to theirs), not that I am going to let them financially suffer - this is on us. All because he couldn't say the words, ""I need help"". Why? Because of his pride? I just don't understand. He's crying a lot to me, suggesting we would be better off without him - I told him that suicide would be the most selfish thing he could do to me. Was that cruel? I'm begging him to see someone, to talk to someone - but I've also told him it can't be me right now as I am so so angry and upset. He's currently on a golfing weekend - it was already paid for and to be honest I told him to go, I needed him away from me. It also happens to be an annual memorial golf weekend in memory of his friend that died by suicide. The only thing I feel will help me feel better is to cut myself. I can't call Samaritans, not with my DD upstairs. They don't offer an online chat service yet, does anyone know of a service that does? I think I need to talk to someone.","2023-09-15","143","129297445","2023-09-19","PragmaticWench","Alternatively, please call your local mental health crisis team.

In my early 20's I was a rampant rabbit. Would be up for anything and had many sexual partners where the sex was just AMAZING. I was a borderline nymphomaniac to say that least. Fast forward 7 years, I'm in a LTR with a very loving partner, perfect in every way and I'm very attracted to him. But my vagina says otherwise! I just can't get turned on for the life of me and my libido has hit rock bottom. We've tried everything we can in the book and I'm starting to pull my hair out as to why it's changed in the last couple of years. I dry up immediately and don't feel that 'excitement' when he touches me, sometimes I feel uncomfortable and quite shameful and would rather avoid it. I've heard testosterone can fix the issue?

Been with my partner 5 years and the sex has never been good. It's been 'ok'. Previous to him I had a high sex drive and spent a lot of time with different flings and short term boyfriends where I thoroughly enjoyed sex so much. Since being with my partner it's just been... shit. He's perfect in every way, apart from sex. He's loving, very handsome, caring, works hard etc but the sexual chemistry is just not there for me. I'm scared to leave, incase I regret it. If I left I could buy him out and own the house but I moved away from home to be in-between both our families and feel if I left, I'd loose everyone I've met through him and fear I'd never meet such a wonderful family as his. I don't want to make a mistake but it's just taking its toll on me now. We haven't had sex for two months because I just can't stand it.

She was telling me that she picks and chooses her shifts through an agency but that she is self-employed. Okay, fine. But I made a comment about tax self assessment and asked if it were much of a pain. The nurse told me that she set up a limited company to pay herself. What's the benefit? Google suggests no NICs (not necessarily a benefit I think - no state pension?) and that company tax rates are lower than personal tax rates. Is that why or are there other benefits? It sounds a little too easy or is she very savvy? I didn't have time to ask her as we were needed elsewhere. I'm NHS staff and don't plan to change, not at the moment anyway.

I am currently in a dilemma although really it’s probably fairly obvious what I should do. However, the more people tell me to LTB in indignation, the more I shove my heels in. So, I’d appreciate some kind assistance. I discovered yesterday via anon message that when I told my partner I was pregnant last year, he took the news badly and essentially went and slept with a couple of other women over a period of a couple of months because I’d ruined his life and he was bitter. He moved out a few months after that but we remained a couple. I discovered that two months ago that two weeks after our daughter was born, whilst he was playing the doting father, he was apparently planning a suicide attempt and because he “didn’t want to make it worse for me” left me abruptly and slept with someone else for a couple of weeks. At the time of his overdose I essentially knew something was wrong despite not talking, went to his house where he was in a state. He cried and begged for me to take him back and since then, has been trying hard to be better. He has slipped up by not coming home from the pub when he says he will, an hour later for instance and says it’s because of his ADHD. He has been making plans for our future etc. However, I said - I don’t understand how you could do these sorts of things to someone you love - and apparently that triggered another depression spiral and now he is questioning whether he loves me because I’m right. Why would you do that. I have previously excused his behaviour because he does suffer from severe depression and PTSD from an attack 4 years ago. I can imagine you are reading this and thinking, are you stupid? Is this not obvious? Well - yes, it is - he brings nothing. But…I love him incredibly deeply, so deeply it physically hurt when he left. And to my not very normal brain, that overrides anything and everything. The logical side of me knows that’s stupid, but the little lost girl clings on to the fact that I adore him despite his huge faults. I cannot bring myself to end it and ask him to leave. Even the idea that I don’t want my daughter to grow up seeing this as the ‘model’ relationship isn’t enough.

I spent a few weekends at his, we had A LOT of sex, did coke and drank a lot. I paid for all my fuel to get there, took alcohol every time and gave him cash for anything else we got.

I remember everything that happened and that did not happen. We had a lot of sex and at the end of the night he was tired and not into it. We went to sleep. He told me to leave or he was going to call the police, it was 8am, he was still drinking alcohol, I was worried about driving but wanted to get out of there, so left. Since then he has sent me voice notes calling me a criminal, a rapist, a monster, an abuser.

There is also a large difference between her LUCID exact handwriting speed – 55th Percentile and her typing speed 88th percentile. In addition, she is hyper-mobile and gets achy hands after writing for a long time. School are saying she can't use a laptop in exams. Does anyone have a link to the rules for being permitted to use a laptop/word processor in exams, other than it be a student’s “normal way of working”?","2023-12-08","29","131307709","2023-12-08","picklefin","@Rolypoly2961 thanks for advice. Her school does not test for dyslexia in 6th form, just exam access tests, and one specific processing test which picked up the 5th percentile score. They have said that their exam access arrangement tests themselves would not pick up dyslexia in a v. bright student. So in that case, if they won't test property themselves, but won't accept a private diagnosis then surely they're discriminating against bright dyslexic students?!"

And as a pp said many landowners welcome sheep as they clean up land very well. Ed should have no issues finding additional grazing.

This has been going on for some time (I would say this stand off is a year or 2 but making me more and more stressed). It will sound so minor and ridiculous but it is creating such stress and anxiety for me. My DH likes to have a bath, not a shower. He likes the ""soak"" and feels like he doesn't get clean properly in a shower (he has job where he can get quite dirty), and also he likes to wet shave in the bath (hates doing it just at a mirror with a sink). He also has a thing about saving water. So this means that he wants me to have a bath first and then he can get in afterwards. So as not to drip feed - i guess we have done this a lot for our relationship - early days we had properties that didn't have a shower, and then with small children we would jump in the water after them for convenience. (and he says why do we have to change?) However I find having a bath time consuming, I often want to shower in the morning not bathe at night, or want to shower when I feel dirty/sweaty (my job can be quite physical). I also think my hair washed much better in shower than rinsing with a jug in the bath. He has a habit of saying ""can we bathe tonight"" and gets really arsy if I say I don't want one as I have already showered or like last night it was so hot yesterday I showered not bathed. He was sulking and angry all evening (made it about something else but I know it was about this). He has asked again this morning ""can we bathe tonight"". I have said it is too hot, and he just goes on about how I can have a cold bath (it's apparently no different to me getting in a lake when i swim???), and that he wants to shave. We end up in this argument of why can't I just have a bath, it saves water if the two of us share a bath (I actually disagree on this as the 2nd person always puts more water in so I think a one person bath and one person shower would be the same - i have quick showers and we don't have a crazy power shower). He has even in the past then refused to have a bath himself and had a strip wash instead (making a point that he hates showers). There is total major guilt trip and such anger from him - i know this is totally weird and out of proportion and I can't live my having this much anxiety over a fucking bath, but equally I can't deal with the fall out when I stand up to him. He thinks I am being totally unreasonable. I am going away for work for a few weeks tomorrow, and seriously thinking of sending an email about this to him when I am away so I can clearly lay down boundaries whilst having some space away. Not sure how else to deal with this in an assertive way without ending up in a major row :(","2023-06-11","451","126804577","2023-06-11","MrsDanversGlidesAgain","He has a habit of saying ""can we bathe tonight"" and gets really arsy if I say I don't want one It sounds to me like he's attached some sort of ritual to it; or he has a really formal way of phrasing it.

His ME/CFS involves exhaustion on his part, lots of napping during the day/after work when he finishes at 4. We had a baby recently, I am on maternity leave and he is working full-time from home. Pre-baby we would nap after work, eat dinner at 9pm and go to bed at midnight. He hasn’t shifted his sleeping pattern since baby has been born, whereas I no longer nap and go to bed at 8:30/9:30 when baby does. We are like passing ships. Since baby has been born, we have been very fortunate to have a family member stay to help with caesarean recovery, laundry etc. Family member has now gone home and honestly I’m finding it lonely and difficult to get things done as baby needs constant entertainment as she’ll cry if I put her down. Today I told husband that I’m struggling doing everything (looking after baby, laundry, dishes, bottles etc) and asked if he could start helping out. I do all the night feeds, the laundry, etc. Only thing I ask is for him to be around and not constantly in bed so I can hand baby to him so I can do the dishwasher/bottles/tidy/shower etc and so he can have some 1:1 with baby. I do all the feeds, nappy changing, dressing, bathing etc. He says I’m being unreasonable because I knew he had a chronic health condition before planning a baby with him. He said other single mum’s manage and he doesn’t understand why I can’t. My views are that his condition does not remove his responsibility as a father and therefore me asking him to help out periodically is not unreasonable. I’m back to my full time job soon and expect things will be tougher. I should also say that he loves our baby so much and is great at interacting etc. He’s also having a tough time at work at the moment and is struggling with anxiety as a result.

The search on DVLA shows that the car has low mileage, one owner and has a 2018 plate. I messaged the seller on FB, asking about the car and if the price was correct and was immediately asked to contact, by email, a completely different person. I used an email address that I don't use for important things (so I don't get scammed too much). The seller responded saying that the car was bought at auction and they mainly deal with transportation and that due to it being at their warehouse we couldn't see it, or pick it up, but they could transport it to us and we have a 5 day full refund guarantee 🤔I asked how much the shipping would be and got this response Thank you for your interest!

The transport fee, which includes insurance tax, will be £125. There are no additional costs or charges. Additionally, you will have a 5-day inspection period. If you don't like the vehicle or find something better, you can return it at our expense. We want to assure you that transactions conducted through our program are 100% secure. Security measures are constantly reviewed and modified to adapt to evolving global circumstances, drawing on both internal assessments and the support of government agencies.

If you wish to reserve the vehicle and obtain more details about the process, I will need your legal full name, shipping address, and phone number to register you as the Legal Buyer. They will then contact you with further information on how to make the purchase It really screams scam doesn't it? The warehouse they say it is, is miles from where the company is based and why have professionals check it, if they're selling for a super cheap price, having bought it at auction?

Where family member comes from, “doing well“ is working for the council or the NHS. .You can do that by going to any university. So no need to aim high. Ditto with teaching.

When I shouted at him he just made fun of my voice and it enraged me soooo much. These are my chief issues with deliveroo etc: There are now so many dangerous drivers either on mopeds or bikes with batteries illegally fitted to them - flagrantly going the wrong way up one-way streets, running reds etc. Very dangerous and a friend of mine recently had someone break into her secure underground parking area to steal her electric bike. There was so much damage to the property and she basically thinks that her bike was nicked to order. I looked into it and deliveroo actually acknowledge that deliveroo drivers 'rent out' their accounts to others, many of whom are undocumented migrants - but they put the responsibility on the original driver to check that the person renting the account has the right to work etc! Complete dereliction of duty, and basically facilitates the exploitation / trafficking of illegal immigrants who then have no legal protection, don't pay tax etc... On a slightly pious level I think it's terrible and lazy that so many people now think it's normal to be able to just order food in so rapidly - like it is genuinely quite aristocratic to expect to press a button and have a shawarma wrap at your door in <20 minutes. People should learn to cook or at least have to walk round the block to the chippy. It's lazy! Meeting the deliveroo orders in small restaurants means it takes twice as long to get your actual food, and it ruins the ambiance when there are loads of deliveroo drivers outside or at the door (though acknowledge this is not the case at Naice restaurants) Everyone I know who works in FS has to basically eat a deliveroo at their desk at 8pm every night - maybe without deliveroo everyone could go home a bit earlier ! ! ! !

He told me to leave or he was going to call the police, it was 8am, he was still drinking alcohol, I was worried about driving but wanted to get out of there, so left. Since then he has sent me voice notes calling me a criminal, a rapist, a monster, an abuser. He said I hadn’t paid my way, which I had, and that he was going to report me to my place of work (children’s services) and report me to the police because I hadn’t paid him, called me a cunt, not even a human, just really vile stuff.

AIBu","Picturequestion","2023-12-02","So I was just chatting to DH about something we have paid someone else to do for us. At great expense. For example a menu for a big event. We are going through a rocky patch. He is getting therapy to work out why he gets so triggered by certain things which can lead to him getting disproportionally angry and at times very verbally aggressive (name calling for example). Discussion yesterday and an agreement that neither of us should give the other unsolicited advice or criticise each other. He has asked me to make a reasonable change in how we co parent and I have asked him to continue to work on being less reactive and angry. So back to the conversation about the ‘menu’. We were talking through it and the different aspects - what we liked and didn’t like. I said about one bit ‘I feel really ‘meh’ about this bit’. He said - in a slightly irritated tone ‘can I ask that when we discuss these things that you talk more positively.’ i stayed very calm. I’m getting very skilled at that! I said that I was just expressing how I feel about something. He said that I had asked him to change how he talks (I.e. when he’s angry and aggressive) because of how it makes me feel and so he is asking me to change how I talk because it dampens his enthusiasm for the ‘menu’ I very calmly said that I didn’t think it was equivalent and that I need to be able to express myself and my feelings and thoughts. I wasnt being critical of him or aggressive or morose. I was positive about the bulk of the ‘menu’. I was just stating my reaction to a part of the menu. He was annoyed that I didn’t agree with him and huffed and walked off. AIBU to think that he doesn’t have the right to ask me not to express my emotional reaction to a part of something that we are paying someone to provide. Or am I right to stand my ground because I shouldn’t have to monitor what I say just in case it dampens his enthusiasm (it might have easily been that he felt ‘meh’ as well).? No LTBs please. That’s the next step if he doesn’t stop the aggressive outbursts. Obviously this is a micro event in a much more complex situation but just based on the information here I’d be keen to hear views. Thanks in advance to anyone that has read and comprehended all of that. I feel quite certain that I am being reasonable but the strength of his annoyance makes it hard to know for sure.

Just before LTB comments start- DH is usually lovely and rarely drinks. DH went out last night- fine. He had no key and was utterly incoherent when I tried to call/text so I waited up until 2am for him to get home so I could lock up. Then went to bed and he was snoring- I kid you not- like he had some sort of jet engine installed in his chest. He also kept violently shaking and making the bed move like there was some sort of earthquake. He seemed fine medically, just very very drunk. I'm 7 months pregnant, perpetually exhausted, and can barely sleep as it is so obviously couldn't cope with this. He wouldn't stop it or wake up fully when I asked (yelled) at him to go and sleep on the sofa if he was so drunk, and in fact kept telling me to fuck off. So, 2.30am I get my stuff and go sleep on the sofa, which isn't the comfiest when heavily pregnant but is better than a bed installed with earthquake plates. I must've fallen asleep because at 4am I am awoken by all the lights suddenly being on and an almightly banging in the hallway and kitchen. The washing machine is also inexplicibly on and so obviously the whole living room/kitchen wall has decided to get in on the action and is being as loud as it can possibly be. I try and sleep through it for about 20 minutes before getting up to see what on earth is going on. DH is now fast asleep again, sprawled across the whole bed, but there is a massive stinking pile of poo on the hallway carpet, with splatters leading in to the kitchen. The bathtub is FULL of what I can only describe as poo-confetti. Everything stinks. It's not diarrhea- I'd be a little more understanding of that- but actual solid poo. Now I'm awake (as are, unfortunately, my nostrils) I can't get back to sleep. My back and legs are killing me from sitting/lying on the sofa but absolutely no way do I want to get back in to bed with him (doubt he'd even make room) and I am refusing to clean up on principle but the whole downstairs utterly reeks. He won't clean up- he's still totally incoherent and is refusing to move out of bed. So now I'm sat here on the sofa, in pain and furious, unable to sleep. What on earth do I do now? I've nowhere to go without a 2+ hour drive which I'm too tired for. What on earth do I do when he wakes up/what is an appropriate punishment/way for him to make up for this?

Should I put up with it? We've been together for three years. Had a bumpy start but got ourselves sorted. Looking back, I think the foundations were laid then around the way we argue and now we can't undo it and I'm worried that I am staying in a really unhealthy relationship. About 80% of the time, we have a great relationship. We are supportive of one another, respectful, good partnership and get on well. However, if we have an argument, it goes down hill, and fast! Today was the latest example. Did all the back to school stuff, was quite a nice day (no kids with us) and popped by McDonalds drive thru on the way home. Driving out, DH put his foot on the brake and a load of chips ended up on the floor. I said “FFS” (loudly) as was annoyed by the mess and made an ill judged poke at him for braking when he did (obviously braking can’t be helped). Really wasn’t anything major and was simply a reaction to a situation but still, wasn’t his fault and so not fair of me. Anyway, I asked him to pull over so I could clean up and he said no. He said he was driving and he would make the decisions and that it was my fault for “throwing” the chips on the floor. This then escalated beyond all recognition with him shouting that he was right about everything (yes - literally). Told me that I had “started it” by shouting at him and told me it was completely my fault and I should apologise and that he would keep shouting until I did. So in and of itself, that’s a stupid argument where had I just said sorry and cleared up it would have gone away. Problem is, he gets so verbally aggressive and so shouty and dominant and entirely unwilling to accept that there would be another way of looking at things and it’s all so QUICK that I start to cry. And then I get told things like I’m pathetic and that I need to stop “whimpering”. And I KNOW this isn’t ok. The only reason I am crying is because I have had my voice taken from me and I am now completely overwhelmed. I genuinely don’t know if I need to change some of my behaviour because I’m nitpicking or if he is the one who is unreasonable. All our arguments are like this. They start off over tiny, inconsequential things, escalate to boiling point very quickly and then I get dominated and cry. BUT (importantly) most of the arguments are started by me. I suppose I need to know if there is anything I can change and that it is reasonable for me to change or if it is just a bad idea to be in this relationship. And to the LTB tribe - I hear you.

Moved house in January (detached house but in a busy, built up bit of London). This neighbour lives next door.

It isn’t a particularly peaceful area (we moved from two minutes away), but I got the message. We were about to start building works but I apologised for any noise and explained we’d do our best to minimise disruption. At some point she seemed to think we were away (we weren’t, our car was) and started parking across our garage. After the second day of this I left a note on the car - “Hey neighbour, please don’t block our garage - we need access for our works. Thanks!” The blocking stops, but she started to park so close to the garage that it’s practically quite difficult to use. I don’t say anything. A month passes. She knocks on our door and says, “You know that note you left on my car? Well your builder is blocking me in” and points to a van that I’ve never seen before. I explain that our builder has a van with his logo all over it and I have no idea whose van that is but it isn’t ours/our trademens’. She glares at me for a few minutes while I talk and then stomps off, no apology. She stops parking badly though. Today she knocked again. Our builder threw a dismantled shed away, and in doing so revealed a missing fence panel between our houses. She’s not happy and wants it replaced. (To be clear our builder didn’t detach anything- the bit of shed wall had just hidden the missing bit of fence from our side, but would always have been obvious to her.) I agreed without thinking too much - the builder is here anyway and it’s two minutes’ work, plus she is, above stuff aside, putting up with about four months and counting of hammering, drilling etc and I don’t want to be petty. But now I’m thinking about this and getting a bit grumpy. It’s her fence afaics (as in, she has the face of it). The missing panel isn’t my problem. And I’m getting pain the ass vibes. Wwyd?

This has been going on for some time (I would say this stand off is a year or 2 but making me more and more stressed). It will sound so minor and ridiculous but it is creating such stress and anxiety for me. My DH likes to have a bath, not a shower. He likes the ""soak"" and feels like he doesn't get clean properly in a shower (he has job where he can get quite dirty), and also he likes to wet shave in the bath (hates doing it just at a mirror with a sink). He also has a thing about saving water. So this means that he wants me to have a bath first and then he can get in afterwards. So as not to drip feed - i guess we have done this a lot for our relationship - early days we had properties that didn't have a shower, and then with small children we would jump in the water after them for convenience. (and he says why do we have to change?) However I find having a bath time consuming, I often want to shower in the morning not bathe at night, or want to shower when I feel dirty/sweaty (my job can be quite physical). I also think my hair washed much better in shower than rinsing with a jug in the bath. He has a habit of saying ""can we bathe tonight"" and gets really arsy if I say I don't want one as I have already showered or like last night it was so hot yesterday I showered not bathed. He was sulking and angry all evening (made it about something else but I know it was about this). He has asked again this morning ""can we bathe tonight"". I have said it is too hot, and he just goes on about how I can have a cold bath (it's apparently no different to me getting in a lake when i swim???), and that he wants to shave. We end up in this argument of why can't I just have a bath, it saves water if the two of us share a bath (I actually disagree on this as the 2nd person always puts more water in so I think a one person bath and one person shower would be the same - i have quick showers and we don't have a crazy power shower). He has even in the past then refused to have a bath himself and had a strip wash instead (making a point that he hates showers). There is total major guilt trip and such anger from him - i know this is totally weird and out of proportion and I can't live my having this much anxiety over a fucking bath, but equally I can't deal with the fall out when I stand up to him. He thinks I am being totally unreasonable. I am going away for work for a few weeks tomorrow, and seriously thinking of sending an email about this to him when I am away so I can clearly lay down boundaries whilst having some space away. Not sure how else to deal with this in an assertive way without ending up in a major row :(","2023-06-11","451","126804204","2023-06-11","VariationsonaTheme","But it’s not using any less water if you hop in there first, so what difference does it make if he’s the only one in the bath?!

If he doesn't there are massive tax penalties. Most people run up a loan account during the year, then issue a dividend to clear the balance at the year end (see above for dividends) Essentially, there is zero way he is taking money, for free, that would not be counted by CMS as income."

Apparently LTF feels insecure about our mutual friend being friends with other people, and at the moment, specifically me. I'm in the middle feeling like an affair partner over middle-aged friendships where mutual friend would ideally not mention to LTF that she's been out with me etc or she feels guilty when talking about mutual friend and I spending time together. Stuff that for a game of soldiers. Unfortunately though mutual friend is someone I really enjoy spending time with, but I feel like walking away.

Time and time again I read that people cheat due to lack of attention, sex, staleness and general neglect within their marriage. Couple often turn outwards, mind on career, children, hobbies and that early years excitement of lust and companionship gets forgotten. Marriages need effort putting in, such as date nights, time away together, communication, new joint interests and most importantly intimacy. If he comes clean and opens up about why he felt the need to do this and behave so inappropriately, can you take it on board and work together to reconnect?

I really don’t want any brash LTB comments because our relationship is generally good. We’ve been together 10 years and I’ve always been the higher earner. Sometimes much higher sometimes only slightly. My job has more career progression and I have worked hard to climb up. DH is more limited, it’s construction sector and depends on seasons, he dips in and out of sole trader and contracted worker so it varies. It is something he has only brought up over the past couple of years that he can feel emasculated that I earn more. That he is the man and he should be the main provider for the family. In a conversation over dinner tonight he’s stated that men aren’t happy unless they are providing for a family. I said he does provide for his family and works very hard and the fact my job happens to pay more is no reflection on him. Would he be happier to have a housewife and us have less money coming in and less of a comfortable life? No he said. so I don’t know what the issue is or where this comes from. I used to think he was proud of me, he used to like telling people what I do and that I’m good at my job. Similarly I am proud of him and tell people so. He used to be my biggest cheerleader but now he seems to see my career has some insult to his ‘masculinity’. He also sees himself as the ‘protector’ of the household. And has bared grudges against my DD17 having a boyfriend in the house like it’s some sort of threat. And when our car was vandalised in the street a little while back (and we knew who it was) he felt his role as ‘protector’ was undermined as I insisted we dealt with it through the right channels rather than the ways he wanted to which were illegal. I have one DD who lives with us and he has 50/50 care of his 2 DDs. There are a lot of women around, is that it? Is there not enough testosterone in our house? He’s great with the girls he does all manner activities from letting them paint his nails and make perfumes to teaching them to fish and play football. He’s really strong on education for them and doing well at school and have careers so I just don’t know where it comes from. to be honest I find it hard not to find it all a bit pathetic but I love this man very much and so I try where I can to respect how he feels.

I’ve arranged for us to have couples therapy in 2 weeks so I can try and raise it in a gentle and calm way. What should I say? Long story short, I’ve been dating this single dad for almost 3 years. I know his kids (8 and 9.5) well. He’s such a loving parent but he’s not coping with 50-50 despite having a part-time nanny I found for him. He works full time in a high level IT job. Long hours. His ex wife is part time and he pays her child support generously due to income differentials. I would never tell him this but you can really tell he’s struggling at this single dad thing. The kids are usually on video games, fighting, or at the weekend getting taken out for meals and cinema and theme parks and bought sweets and slushies and everything they nag for (nice kids not their fault they know whining works). DP can’t seem to manage set bedtimes or basic continence (forgets to get them to drink water in the day and they drink gallons at night then wet beds). He spends a load of time when he has them trying to work. I know this is not right. I’m single mum to one who I share 50/50 with his dad. My ex does all the basics and more and his mum is there most days to make sure he does! I don’t want to move in with my partner and parent his kids for him. It’s not my place as they have 2 parents. He’s tried asking for this of course. But, once divorced, I value my independence and for my kid to live v near his dad and other relatives. Nowadays DP is always complaining about the kids. Says they’re exhausting. He has mental health struggles like depression and we both think he probably has autism. He has been signed off work sick and takes days off during wfh secretly then has to catch up at weekends. For majority of our relationships he was doing EOW with 2/3 after schools a week with kids but no mid week overnights. This was til about a year ago. Kids were younger when he and ex 1st split. But he kept asking for the 50-50 and after youngest turned 7 ex wife agreed and got a new BF and new job. I don’t see DP any less cos of 50/50 he simply has more overnights on days I wouldn’t see him anyway. But I get less from the relationship in general. He’s now often exhausted, drained, depressed and snappy. I know, poss LTB. The kids don’t seem massively happy and keep asking to go ‘home’ to their mum’s. Ex wife gave up work when they were babies and was always the primary parent. I’ve asked partner why he wants this 50/50 so much and he said ‘so me and her are equal’ referring to ex wife. I’m not sure it’s about the kids. What should I say in therapy?","2023-10-03","42","129661354","2023-10-03","Goldflap","Why is he still paying his ex wife if he is doing 50/50 ?

This has been going on for some time (I would say this stand off is a year or 2 but making me more and more stressed). It will sound so minor and ridiculous but it is creating such stress and anxiety for me. My DH likes to have a bath, not a shower. He likes the ""soak"" and feels like he doesn't get clean properly in a shower (he has job where he can get quite dirty), and also he likes to wet shave in the bath (hates doing it just at a mirror with a sink). He also has a thing about saving water. So this means that he wants me to have a bath first and then he can get in afterwards. So as not to drip feed - i guess we have done this a lot for our relationship - early days we had properties that didn't have a shower, and then with small children we would jump in the water after them for convenience. (and he says why do we have to change?) However I find having a bath time consuming, I often want to shower in the morning not bathe at night, or want to shower when I feel dirty/sweaty (my job can be quite physical). I also think my hair washed much better in shower than rinsing with a jug in the bath. He has a habit of saying ""can we bathe tonight"" and gets really arsy if I say I don't want one as I have already showered or like last night it was so hot yesterday I showered not bathed. He was sulking and angry all evening (made it about something else but I know it was about this). He has asked again this morning ""can we bathe tonight"". I have said it is too hot, and he just goes on about how I can have a cold bath (it's apparently no different to me getting in a lake when i swim???), and that he wants to shave. We end up in this argument of why can't I just have a bath, it saves water if the two of us share a bath (I actually disagree on this as the 2nd person always puts more water in so I think a one person bath and one person shower would be the same - i have quick showers and we don't have a crazy power shower). He has even in the past then refused to have a bath himself and had a strip wash instead (making a point that he hates showers). There is total major guilt trip and such anger from him - i know this is totally weird and out of proportion and I can't live my having this much anxiety over a fucking bath, but equally I can't deal with the fall out when I stand up to him. He thinks I am being totally unreasonable. I am going away for work for a few weeks tomorrow, and seriously thinking of sending an email about this to him when I am away so I can clearly lay down boundaries whilst having some space away.

When I shouted at him he just made fun of my voice and it enraged me soooo much. These are my chief issues with deliveroo etc: There are now so many dangerous drivers either on mopeds or bikes with batteries illegally fitted to them - flagrantly going the wrong way up one-way streets, running reds etc. Very dangerous and a friend of mine recently had someone break into her secure underground parking area to steal her electric bike. There was so much damage to the property and she basically thinks that her bike was nicked to order. I looked into it and deliveroo actually acknowledge that deliveroo drivers 'rent out' their accounts to others, many of whom are undocumented migrants - but they put the responsibility on the original driver to check that the person renting the account has the right to work etc! Complete dereliction of duty, and basically facilitates the exploitation / trafficking of illegal immigrants who then have no legal protection, don't pay tax etc...

I have one child, a boy, he is 2 and a half. He was an absolutely beautiful baby and I know there may be some bias there but he was so smiley, gentle and loving. I loved him so much, I still do. I noticed he started to change at around 16 months. We had a play date with another child the same age as him and he was awful to her, pushing her away from his toys and wouldn’t let her near anything. As far as I can tell that’s been the start of over twelve months of very challenging behaviour towards other children. Between 17-20 months I had daily reports of him biting at nursery. The biting seems to have stopped now but he pushes and he will kick and hit. I know everyone will say what am I doing about it as a parent and honestly everything I can. I say no firmly. I follow him round like a hawk and physically stop him hitting or anything. But it’s not foolproof, a few days ago he was at the top of a slide and shoved a little boy away. I know he knows what no means but he carries on doing it. It’s now been fourteen months since I noticed him pushing that little girl and I can’t put into words how upset it makes me. I am worried he’s just quite aggressive by nature, or that maybe I’ve somehow done something that has made him that way? I am posting because I feel like we’re on the cusp in a way of that sort of behaviour being tolerated. In very young toddlers people sort of expect it but by three (he will be three in December) I don’t think it will be tolerated at all. And he won’t have any friends and will be isolated at school. He has become very aggressive elsewhere as well. He has started to scream at me and push me - he can’t push me over or anything but he’s really strong! - and he has destroyed a few things by hurling them around and just screaming in this sort of mad rage. That’s just been this past week. My big worry is the dislike I feel for him when he is unkind. I hated bullies at school and I always thought I’d have a zero tolerance approach to any physical stuff but it’s harder than I thought when your child doesn’t listen to a word you say. Even when he’s being affectionate which tbf is a lot of the time, he can be delightful, but he can be quite rough, climbing up on me and he often laughs if I say ow or wince a bit. I just am desperate to know what to do?","2023-06-25","97","127152455","2023-06-25","Isheabastard","I agree with others it sounds like normal toddler stuff. I would suggest you go out and get hold of some good books written by highly qualified authors that explain all the developmental changes that small children go through to become the fully formed person that we all become. It’s fascinating stuff from when babies are born and they don’t understand that their mother is a separate entity, to when a small child can understand deferred gratification, and how the teenage brain grows at different rates. You sound under confident, so make yourself an expert. Next time you may find someone else comes to you for the answer!"

I called the police and he was bailed with conditions, but I eventually forgave him and dropped the charges. Since then he's been living apart from me and the kids and we've been working on our marriage and his issues. Things have been better over the last few weeks and he's been staying at the house with us a lot more, but it feels like every time I let my guard down and start to feel comfortable and safe, something bad happens. He's got better, but he has a tendency to overreact to even the slightest bit of negativity from me, either real or perceived, meaning that if I'm ever even slightly bad tempered, or stressed, or ill, or even if I disagree with him about something, he takes it really harshly and completely shuts down on me. He just totally closes off emotionally and seems to lack empathy. He'll walk away, leave the house, give me the silent treatment, threaten to leave me, block me etc. When things are good between us, he's loving and affectionate and reasonable and great fun to be around. But as soon as he detects any kind of negativity from me, he just withdraws and goes stone cold. Because of this, before August I felt like I was always on eggshells around him, worried about doing or saying the wrong thing and setting him off. We have 3 kids, the younger ones are 2 and almost 1. We're pretty much always tired and stressed and ill, so his reactions were a regular occurrence. We've been having counselling since August and he has been making an effort to change. He has improved in a lot of ways, but I just don't know if I can stay on this rollercoaster anymore. It's like things are fine one minute, and then we're on the verge of divorce again the next. Fast forward to today. I should say that the incident in August happened because I was really ill. He didn't believe me and he treated me horribly. This weekend, he was ill with a bad cold/covid type bug, meaning that I did the bulk of looking after the kids and house. But now I've caught it, and yet again he's just withdrawn on me. Yesterday I tried to power through and carry on as normal, but I could sense that he was withdrawing and being less affectionate towards me. This morning I woke up and felt absolutely awful. I could really have done with a day in bed. He took me asking him for help in the morning as a criticism, and when I asked if he could take some time off (he works flexibly) to do the school/nursery run so I could go back to bed instead of going out in the cold with the heavy double buggy, he refused and walked out of the house while I was crying and begging him to stay and help me. His reason was that he won't go to school or nursery because they know what he did in August, so it's too uncomfortable for him and the staff for him to go there. But both school and nursery have said they understand the situation and have no problem with him collecting/being around the children, so I don't really think that's a good enough reason. I feel like he should have put his pride to one side and cared more about his ill and struggling wife than the feelings of the nursery staff or random people on the school run. I'm so burnt out and exhausted on top of being ill and he knows that. I feel so let down by him, yet again. I think it's dawning on me that he's never going to be capable of being there for me when I need him, and that I have a lifetime of being let down by him when I need support, either physically or emotionally, if I stay with him. This is far from the first time he's been shit to me when I've been ill, and is part of a pattern of him shutting down and abandoning me when I become too needy for him to deal with or he feels 'attacked'. I keep thinking I deserve better than this. But I'm so scared. I'm scared of losing him when I love him so much. I'm scared of having to cope with 3 small kids on my own. I'm scared of being alone forever. I'm scared of the upheaval of separating and how I'd financially manage with 3 kids. I'm scared of regretting it and watching him move on and be happy with someone else. I'm scared of the stigma of being a single mum with kids from 2 different dads. I'm scared of making a mistake and ruining mine and my kids lives and futures. What on earth do I do? Do I keep working on things and hoping he'll change? I'm not perfect, I have my own faults and I'll admit I've been a bit of a mess since August. I think I'm dealing with some sort of trauma or having some kind of breakdown to be honest. I am trying to address it, but the kids are pretty all consuming at the moment, so it's difficult. I've been on Mumsnet for years so I know everyone will tell me to LTB. My family and friends have all told me to leave him. But I just don't feel strong enough. It's really not as easy as 'just leave' when it's your actual life. And I love him so much. I don't know what to think or do. Thank you if you've managed to read all of this. It's so long, I don't really expect anyone to.

I am 49 years old and not particularly fit, although I have been exercising for a few years, 5 days a week. For the past year, I've been following an exercise program that I started with PT, who I then dropped as I really didn't get on with the plans she was proposing. I felt her weight ranges were too high and aimed at 20-somethings, and not really for me. I have carried on doing the same exercises she gave me a year ago, which has included weights 3 times a week, but I am finding it too long and too boring/difficult to continue. I have fixed routines every week on Mon, Weds and Fri. Mondays are: Lunges - 4 sets of 12, with 4kg weights (she had me doing 12.5kg weights which I just could not manage so I went back to body weight and then moved on to 4/5kg weights) Dumbbell squats - 4 sets of 12, carrying 17.5kg weights (I have built up to this but also struggling some weeks with this, today I dropped back to 15kg and found this tough) Barbell rows (30kg), lateral raises (4/5kg), front raises (3/4kg) and floor press (10-12.5kg) all 4 sets of 12 reps each This takes me over an hour to complete in the mornings. I have had a 4-week break from exercising, I have started again today and found this so monotonous and time consuming. On Tuesday and Thursdays I do HIIT classes with an app, they are <30 mins long each, and whilst I am not the fittest person, these are much more doable and are varied. I look forward to these days like they are cheat days, although I do sweat and work hard. I don't want to give up on weights but is this just too long training with too many reps? Is my current schedule what is needed to see any gains, or should I be looking to change this up? I don't want to stop weight training, but this is just too long and too monotonous for me to continue with. My wish list is for shorter sessions with less reps so I can get through them quicker and more effectively, without getting bored or fed up.","2024-01-22","23","132429687","2024-01-22","RayKray","There's a thread further down called something like 'do you lift weights to build muscle or get strong' where we discuss this and I posted a link about rep ranges.

I do different programmes at different times that might focus more on strength and muscle (and technique)"

Just before LTB comments start- DH is usually lovely and rarely drinks. DH went out last night- fine. He had no key and was utterly incoherent when I tried to call/text so I waited up until 2am for him to get home so I could lock up. Then went to bed and he was snoring- I kid you not- like he had some sort of jet engine installed in his chest. He also kept violently shaking and making the bed move like there was some sort of earthquake. He seemed fine medically, just very very drunk. I'm 7 months pregnant, perpetually exhausted, and can barely sleep as it is so obviously couldn't cope with this. He wouldn't stop it or wake up fully when I asked (yelled) at him to go and sleep on the sofa if he was so drunk, and in fact kept telling me to fuck off. So, 2.30am I get my stuff and go sleep on the sofa, which isn't the comfiest when heavily pregnant but is better than a bed installed with earthquake plates. I must've fallen asleep because at 4am I am awoken by all the lights suddenly being on and an almightly banging in the hallway and kitchen. The washing machine is also inexplicibly on and so obviously the whole living room/kitchen wall has decided to get in on the action and is being as loud as it can possibly be. I try and sleep through it for about 20 minutes before getting up to see what on earth is going on. DH is now fast asleep again, sprawled across the whole bed, but there is a massive stinking pile of poo on the hallway carpet, with splatters leading in to the kitchen. The bathtub is FULL of what I can only describe as poo-confetti. Everything stinks. It's not diarrhea- I'd be a little more understanding of that- but actual solid poo. Now I'm awake (as are, unfortunately, my nostrils) I can't get back to sleep. My back and legs are killing me from sitting/lying on the sofa but absolutely no way do I want to get back in to bed with him (doubt he'd even make room) and I am refusing to clean up on principle but the whole downstairs utterly reeks. He won't clean up- he's still totally incoherent and is refusing to move out of bed. So now I'm sat here on the sofa, in pain and furious, unable to sleep. What on earth do I do now? I've nowhere to go without a 2+ hour drive which I'm too tired for. What on earth do I do when he wakes up/what is an appropriate punishment/way for him to make up for this?

I have name changed but I am a LT poster. I was dating this guy, it was casual and there were quite a few red flags which I stupidly ignored. He is kind of well known publicly, but has massive delusions of grandeur and very self important and possibly NPD. Not really that important publicly as he thinks he is. I spent a few weekends at his, we had A LOT of sex, did coke and drank a lot. I paid for all my fuel to get there, took alcohol every time and gave him cash for anything else we got. The third time I stayed there (by this point I had massive reservations) in the morning he woke up and accused me of attempting to rape him. I remember everything that happened and that did not happen. We had a lot of sex and at the end of the night he was tired and not into it. We went to sleep. He told me to leave or he was going to call the police, it was 8am, he was still drinking alcohol, I was worried about driving but wanted to get out of there, so left. Since then he has sent me voice notes calling me a criminal, a rapist, a monster, an abuser. He said I hadn’t paid my way, which I had, and that he was going to report me to my place of work (children’s services) and report me to the police because I hadn’t paid him, called me a cunt, not even a human, just really vile stuff. I sent him more money as I panicked and was really upset and said if I haven’t paid my way I am sorry but he just kept calling me a rapist. Now I have sent the money he’s gone quiet, but I am so shaken and upset. I don’t know whether to just mark it down to shite judgment on my part and move on or should I call the police as it’s blackmail, and I didn’t do anything untoward to him.","2023-10-31","496","130376715","2023-10-31","itsgoingtobeabumpyride","The pearl clutches are out in force tonight, anyone would think it's Halloween and posters have all turned up as Hyacinth Bucket 🙄 Good on you op, for contacting the police, ignore the outraged posters who believe you should live in a nice sanitised box and only be pulled out to go to work.

Where have got the research from? Tigers are more opportunistic and aggressive hunters, and not that fussy, like the bull shark, they are fast and go shallow, but I've not heard once they get a taste for humans they will stay in those hunting grounds? If that's the case then stop people going in the water in that area. Your analogy to dangerous dogs really doesn't work or justify killing these incredible beasts which are essential for biodiversity."

But something I've been trying and failing to understand re. the concept of 'non binary' in the 'gender movement' (or whatever it is/ought to be called) is that on the one hand, people who subscribe to that philosophy are saying they reject the traditional idea of explicit male/femaleness (because if ""trans women are women"" then they have swapped for instance). But then if you have 'non binary' individuals isn't that pretty much saying oh yes, actually there is a binary - and some people don't subscribe to it? I do acknowledge sex =/= gender but not all NB people are intersex/have DSD <<thoroughly discombobulated>>","2024-01-23","520","132470223","2024-01-23","IamAporcupine","This 100% And very individualistic"

Spanish footballer vs her federation's president.","AussieCallil","2023-08-26","I'm really impressed with Jenni Hermoso's No Shit Tolerated attitude on this. Says she did not consent to be forcibly grabbed by the head and kissed full on the mouth (bleurgh) by Spanish football federation president Luis Rubiales. He dismissed it as an exuberant, celebratory 'peck'. Apparently her complaint is ""false feminism"" and an undeserved ""social assassination"" of his character. <sigh> 🙄 https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U6C6qPpoG6I (Independent Sport evidence clip) [Real charmer. He also pointed at the players then grabbed his crotch as Spain won. Standing next to the Queen and her 16-year-old daughter. Classy]. 81 players confirm they will not play for Spain's women's team until he is removed from his post. Good for them. Hermoso released a long statement on social media: ""I want to make clear that at no time did the conversation to which Mr Luis Rubiales refers to in his address take place and, above all, was his kiss ever consensual."" She added his claims were ""categorically false and part of the manipulative culture that he has generated"". ""I feel the need to report this incident because I believe no person, in any work, sports or social setting should be a victim of these types of non-consensual behaviours. I felt vulnerable and a victim of impulsive-driven, sexist, out-of-place act, without any consent on my part,"" she continued. ""Quite simply, I was not respected."" She added that she was put ""under continuous pressure"" to help with a ""statement that could justify"" Rubiales' actions - and so were her family, friends and team-mates. England's Lionesses backed her immediately. Yay them. Their official statement: “Unacceptable actions allowed to happen by a sexist and patriarchal organisation. Abuse is abuse and we have all seen the truth. “The behaviour of those who think they are invincible must not be tolerated and people shouldn’t need convincing to take action against any form of harassment. We all stand with you, Jenni Hermoso and all players of the Spanish team.” https://www.bbc.co.uk./sport/football/66621772 https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/24/spanish-football-president-in-kissing-row-denies-new-misogyny-allegations","2023-08-26","85","128736918","2023-08-27","WeetabixTowels","Anyway @Buildingthefuture care to explain how a woman hugging a man is sexual assault but a man kissing a woman on the lips against her will isn’t?
