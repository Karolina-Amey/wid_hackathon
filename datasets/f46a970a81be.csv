"Period sex","Partner says period sex 'isn't something he likes the idea of'. I've never been with someone who has had an issue with it and honestly, it makes me feel gross during that week because I know he's not interested Other than that sex life is very active, usually more than 3x a week. He is more than happy with all sorts of other things, bum stuff, other stuff - just that week he doesn't like the idea of. I've googled and so many articles saying LTB if this is a thing I am interested to hear others experiences"
"To ask what you would do","Posting here for traffic which I know makes me unreasonable. New name but LTP. Been around for Pom bear, Mexican house thief and I’d know how to get my laundry darked on DH has felt ill since Sat. He is drinking fine and managing to eat very small amounts. He has stomach cramps and nausea. This morning he has now said he has palpitations and mild breathless too. He’s notorious for not seeking medical advice. Negative Covid test. Should I press him to call 111 or am I worrying unnecessarily?"
"To ask you what your marriage/LTR is like?","I've been with my DH for 17 years, married for 13 this year. When we met I didn't fall deeply in love, it grew to a stable love over time. I'd had a string of bad relationships and thought I was making a grown up choice. I told myself that sparks and head over heels was a fairy tale. Only, now I'm here at 47 with a 9 year old DS and I'm not particularly happy in the relationship. I'm not deeply unhappy, my DH is a good man but we've become more like co-parents who very occasionally have sex. I spend a lot of time doing my own thing and avoiding too much time with him. His habits annoy me and I'm sure he'd the same about me! I care about him, he's one of my closest friends.. but I keep thinking does he deserve a better love than I give him and vice versa? Or do I just need to grow the F up? Work on myself and my issues? This feels like a diamond shoes too tight kind of problem to be honest. Marriages exist on less. So, how would you describe your marriage?"
"How to compromise when dating","Currently long term single and have been told my standards might be too high! I’m reconsidering what my deal breakers are and what I am looking for in a partner. Does the person you are with (LTR or married to) match the person you envisaged being with? Or did you make small concessions? What sort of things did you compromise on and did they turn out to not matter in the grand scheme of things?"
"Stay or go (cheater)","I don’t know if it’s my personality or maybe linked to my autism but I struggle to make decisions and always need a really balanced pros and cons list. I am currently in a dilemma although really it’s probably fairly obvious what I should do. However, the more people tell me to LTB in indignation, the more I shove my heels in. So, I’d appreciate some kind assistance. I discovered yesterday via anon message that when I told my partner I was pregnant last year, he took the news badly and essentially went and slept with a couple of other women over a period of a couple of months because I’d ruined his life and he was bitter. He moved out a few months after that but we remained a couple. I discovered that two months ago that two weeks after our daughter was born, whilst he was playing the doting father, he was apparently planning a suicide attempt and because he “didn’t want to make it worse for me” left me abruptly and slept with someone else for a couple of weeks. At the time of his overdose I essentially knew something was wrong despite not talking, went to his house where he was in a state. He cried and begged for me to take him back and since then, has been trying hard to be better. He has slipped up by not coming home from the pub when he says he will, an hour later for instance and says it’s because of his ADHD. He has been making plans for our future etc. However, I said - I don’t understand how you could do these sorts of things to someone you love - and apparently that triggered another depression spiral and now he is questioning whether he loves me because I’m right. Why would you do that. I have previously excused his behaviour because he does suffer from severe depression and PTSD from an attack 4 years ago. I can imagine you are reading this and thinking, are you stupid? Is this not obvious? Well - yes, it is - he brings nothing. But…I love him incredibly deeply, so deeply it physically hurt when he left. And to my not very normal brain, that overrides anything and everything. The logical side of me knows that’s stupid, but the little lost girl clings on to the fact that I adore him despite his huge faults. I cannot bring myself to end it and ask him to leave. Even the idea that I don’t want my daughter to grow up seeing this as the ‘model’ relationship isn’t enough. I’m crying as I write this, I love her more than anything so why can’t I take the right steps and make the right decisions. thank you for reading"
"Should I be contacting the police.","I am not asking for judgement firstly. I have name changed but I am a LT poster. I was dating this guy, it was casual and there were quite a few red flags which I stupidly ignored. He is kind of well known publicly, but has massive delusions of grandeur and very self important and possibly NPD. Not really that important publicly as he thinks he is. I spent a few weekends at his, we had A LOT of sex, did coke and drank a lot. I paid for all my fuel to get there, took alcohol every time and gave him cash for anything else we got. The third time I stayed there (by this point I had massive reservations) in the morning he woke up and accused me of attempting to rape him. I remember everything that happened and that did not happen. We had a lot of sex and at the end of the night he was tired and not into it. We went to sleep. He told me to leave or he was going to call the police, it was 8am, he was still drinking alcohol, I was worried about driving but wanted to get out of there, so left. Since then he has sent me voice notes calling me a criminal, a rapist, a monster, an abuser. He said I hadn’t paid my way, which I had, and that he was going to report me to my place of work (children’s services) and report me to the police because I hadn’t paid him, called me a cunt, not even a human, just really vile stuff. I sent him more money as I panicked and was really upset and said if I haven’t paid my way I am sorry but he just kept calling me a rapist. Now I have sent the money he’s gone quiet, but I am so shaken and upset. I don’t know whether to just mark it down to shite judgment on my part and move on or should I call the police as it’s blackmail, and I didn’t do anything untoward to him."
"AIBU to think this guy is a Halloween fun sponge?","Now, I hate Halloween with a passion, always have always will, so I do the Mumsnetty thing of not opening my door to Trick or Treaters on the night, but some random bloke has decided to create a set of rules and regulations that he (seriously, really seriously) expects people to follow: With the spooky season upon us: A few people have asked me draw something up to avoid a repeat of last years Halloween. Here are a few ideas I’ve thought of – am welcoming feedback on this consultation 1. Do you really need to buy decorations and toys that are single use plastic 2. No misleading signs in shops and bakeries, pubs and public buildings. “e.g. danger keep out” 3. No flashing lights or loud noises that could be challenging to a persons of additional needs 4. No outfits that are frightening to dogs 5. No trick or treating on main roads, LTN ‘s or other special roads ONLY. 6. Any houses wishing to participate must pre-register (cannot be a house near a dog park). 7. Any snacks must be accompanied by an allergy sheet – it the responsibility of the “candy donor” to check for allergies from a responsible adult 8. Families wishing to trick or treat must pre-register 10 working days in advance and specify their route and times along side details of the fancy dress. For neighbours via this app to lodge any objections. 9. Any decorations deemed inappropriate to be removed promptly upon regular patrol 10. No children under 9 The only point I agree with is no.1 - AIBU in thinking let people live, it's one night?"
"Stand off with DH over bathing making me so anxious","LTR, both in 50's. This has been going on for some time (I would say this stand off is a year or 2 but making me more and more stressed). It will sound so minor and ridiculous but it is creating such stress and anxiety for me. My DH likes to have a bath, not a shower. He likes the ""soak"" and feels like he doesn't get clean properly in a shower (he has job where he can get quite dirty), and also he likes to wet shave in the bath (hates doing it just at a mirror with a sink). He also has a thing about saving water. So this means that he wants me to have a bath first and then he can get in afterwards. So as not to drip feed - i guess we have done this a lot for our relationship - early days we had properties that didn't have a shower, and then with small children we would jump in the water after them for convenience. (and he says why do we have to change?) However I find having a bath time consuming, I often want to shower in the morning not bathe at night, or want to shower when I feel dirty/sweaty (my job can be quite physical). I also think my hair washed much better in shower than rinsing with a jug in the bath. He has a habit of saying ""can we bathe tonight"" and gets really arsy if I say I don't want one as I have already showered or like last night it was so hot yesterday I showered not bathed. He was sulking and angry all evening (made it about something else but I know it was about this). He has asked again this morning ""can we bathe tonight"". I have said it is too hot, and he just goes on about how I can have a cold bath (it's apparently no different to me getting in a lake when i swim???), and that he wants to shave. We end up in this argument of why can't I just have a bath, it saves water if the two of us share a bath (I actually disagree on this as the 2nd person always puts more water in so I think a one person bath and one person shower would be the same - i have quick showers and we don't have a crazy power shower). He has even in the past then refused to have a bath himself and had a strip wash instead (making a point that he hates showers). There is total major guilt trip and such anger from him - i know this is totally weird and out of proportion and I can't live my having this much anxiety over a fucking bath, but equally I can't deal with the fall out when I stand up to him. He thinks I am being totally unreasonable. I am going away for work for a few weeks tomorrow, and seriously thinking of sending an email about this to him when I am away so I can clearly lay down boundaries whilst having some space away. Not sure how else to deal with this in an assertive way without ending up in a major row :("
"Husband’s disability and parenting","Husband has ME/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, it’s a chronic illness and he is registered as disabled. His ME/CFS involves exhaustion on his part, lots of napping during the day/after work when he finishes at 4. We had a baby recently, I am on maternity leave and he is working full-time from home. Pre-baby we would nap after work, eat dinner at 9pm and go to bed at midnight. He hasn’t shifted his sleeping pattern since baby has been born, whereas I no longer nap and go to bed at 8:30/9:30 when baby does. We are like passing ships. Since baby has been born, we have been very fortunate to have a family member stay to help with caesarean recovery, laundry etc. Family member has now gone home and honestly I’m finding it lonely and difficult to get things done as baby needs constant entertainment as she’ll cry if I put her down. Today I told husband that I’m struggling doing everything (looking after baby, laundry, dishes, bottles etc) and asked if he could start helping out. I do all the night feeds, the laundry, etc. Only thing I ask is for him to be around and not constantly in bed so I can hand baby to him so I can do the dishwasher/bottles/tidy/shower etc and so he can have some 1:1 with baby. I do all the feeds, nappy changing, dressing, bathing etc. He says I’m being unreasonable because I knew he had a chronic health condition before planning a baby with him. He said other single mum’s manage and he doesn’t understand why I can’t. My views are that his condition does not remove his responsibility as a father and therefore me asking him to help out periodically is not unreasonable. I’m back to my full time job soon and expect things will be tougher. I should also say that he loves our baby so much and is great at interacting etc. He’s also having a tough time at work at the moment and is struggling with anxiety as a result. He’s a good man, there is no LTB etc. AIBU?"
"Did I do a one night stand wrong?! Getting ripped from my friends","My friends are currently laughing at my “failed” one night stand last night. Very unlike me, but I met up with a guy yesterday at his place. I’ve come out of a LTR and definitely do not want a boyfriend, at all. I just wanted sex. Anyway, he paid for me to get to his house for 3pm yesterday (friends thought the time was hilarious for some reason??), we talked for an hour or so and then had sex. After sex he said he’d like it if I stayed the night (I presume for further/morning sex). We watched a film, had sex and then spoke a bit longer. We got on well and had the same sense of humour so it wasn’t awkward or anything! Anyway, I left at around 11 this morning after staying the night (we didn’t have sex this morning, just cuddled). friends feel I’ve done it wrong because: I stayed the night? Apparently you should leave straight after the deed? (Not sure why this is weird - it’s nice to sleep next to someone and cuddle?) We were laughing and talking (apparently this is “not boundaried”) i arrived too early and should have gone around 10pm Is there a rule book I’m missing out on?!? Was I a weirdo?? I thought I was being normal!"
"AIBU... to ask for your help finding a boring gift?!","My niece is very lovely, but very dull. And with VERY different taste to mine. She has no hobbies, doesn't cook or garden, isn't interested in hair, beauty or smelly stuff, doesn't read or do puzzles... I just CANNOT think of anything to get her. Now it's an emergency situation, and whatever I get will have to come from the dreaded Amazon. Budget <£40 Please help!!"
"How can I tell DP I don't want him to try out my sport?!","I do Muay Thai twice per week. One time in a small group. One time as a one-on-one with a coach. It's my completely happy place. I absolutely lose myself in it, especially at one-on-ones. DP has said he might be interested in trying it out and is thinking about booking a one-on-one with the coach. This would be totally separate from my coaching sessions. But I feel really grumpy about it. It's hard to articulate but I don't want him to. I know I sound like an unreasonable spoiled child. I know I can't (and wouldn't) stop him from giving it a try. But it feels kind of sacrosanct and like something I 'own' just for myself. And I do mean 'own' because its so different from a normal sports club or fitness class - its a real sense of ownership of my skills, my body, my time, my confidence. I just don't want DP anywhere near it. How the hell can I articulate this without sounding like an absolute twat <with the caveat that I know I'm actually being a bit of a twat>? DP's a normal, reasonable human but I need the right words to explain my thoughts. Give me some words, please MN, so I can formulate them into some kind of articulate way to tell DP to fuck off!"
"to think that Deliveroo etc should be banned!","Hi all, I live in London and was recently nearly knocked off my bike by a deliveroo driver on a moped (he was completely in the wrong, though will not be drawing a road diagram to illustrate lol). When I shouted at him he just made fun of my voice and it enraged me soooo much. These are my chief issues with deliveroo etc: There are now so many dangerous drivers either on mopeds or bikes with batteries illegally fitted to them - flagrantly going the wrong way up one-way streets, running reds etc. Very dangerous and a friend of mine recently had someone break into her secure underground parking area to steal her electric bike. There was so much damage to the property and she basically thinks that her bike was nicked to order. I looked into it and deliveroo actually acknowledge that deliveroo drivers 'rent out' their accounts to others, many of whom are undocumented migrants - but they put the responsibility on the original driver to check that the person renting the account has the right to work etc! Complete dereliction of duty, and basically facilitates the exploitation / trafficking of illegal immigrants who then have no legal protection, don't pay tax etc... On a slightly pious level I think it's terrible and lazy that so many people now think it's normal to be able to just order food in so rapidly - like it is genuinely quite aristocratic to expect to press a button and have a shawarma wrap at your door in <20 minutes. People should learn to cook or at least have to walk round the block to the chippy. It's lazy! Meeting the deliveroo orders in small restaurants means it takes twice as long to get your actual food, and it ruins the ambiance when there are loads of deliveroo drivers outside or at the door (though acknowledge this is not the case at Naice restaurants) Everyone I know who works in FS has to basically eat a deliveroo at their desk at 8pm every night - maybe without deliveroo everyone could go home a bit earlier ! ! ! ! YABU - let me have my massaman curry you calvinistic treat-hater YANBU - deliveroo is a scourge"
"Shark Attack","Nice to see that the shark that killed a swimmer in Egypt was caught and beaten to death on the beach. <Slow handclap>"
"DH policing how I talk. AIBu","So I was just chatting to DH about something we have paid someone else to do for us. At great expense. For example a menu for a big event. We are going through a rocky patch. He is getting therapy to work out why he gets so triggered by certain things which can lead to him getting disproportionally angry and at times very verbally aggressive (name calling for example). Discussion yesterday and an agreement that neither of us should give the other unsolicited advice or criticise each other. He has asked me to make a reasonable change in how we co parent and I have asked him to continue to work on being less reactive and angry. So back to the conversation about the ‘menu’. We were talking through it and the different aspects - what we liked and didn’t like. I said about one bit ‘I feel really ‘meh’ about this bit’. He said - in a slightly irritated tone ‘can I ask that when we discuss these things that you talk more positively.’ i stayed very calm. I’m getting very skilled at that! I said that I was just expressing how I feel about something. He said that I had asked him to change how he talks (I.e. when he’s angry and aggressive) because of how it makes me feel and so he is asking me to change how I talk because it dampens his enthusiasm for the ‘menu’ I very calmly said that I didn’t think it was equivalent and that I need to be able to express myself and my feelings and thoughts. I wasnt being critical of him or aggressive or morose. I was positive about the bulk of the ‘menu’. I was just stating my reaction to a part of the menu. He was annoyed that I didn’t agree with him and huffed and walked off. AIBU to think that he doesn’t have the right to ask me not to express my emotional reaction to a part of something that we are paying someone to provide. Or am I right to stand my ground because I shouldn’t have to monitor what I say just in case it dampens his enthusiasm (it might have easily been that he felt ‘meh’ as well).? No LTBs please. That’s the next step if he doesn’t stop the aggressive outbursts. Obviously this is a micro event in a much more complex situation but just based on the information here I’d be keen to hear views. Thanks in advance to anyone that has read and comprehended all of that. I feel quite certain that I am being reasonable but the strength of his annoyance makes it hard to know for sure. Would be great to have different perspectives."
"Poo-gate, what to do?","To be honest I just need to rant, I know IANBU but don't know what to do except seethe. Just before LTB comments start- DH is usually lovely and rarely drinks. DH went out last night- fine. He had no key and was utterly incoherent when I tried to call/text so I waited up until 2am for him to get home so I could lock up. Then went to bed and he was snoring- I kid you not- like he had some sort of jet engine installed in his chest. He also kept violently shaking and making the bed move like there was some sort of earthquake. He seemed fine medically, just very very drunk. I'm 7 months pregnant, perpetually exhausted, and can barely sleep as it is so obviously couldn't cope with this. He wouldn't stop it or wake up fully when I asked (yelled) at him to go and sleep on the sofa if he was so drunk, and in fact kept telling me to fuck off. So, 2.30am I get my stuff and go sleep on the sofa, which isn't the comfiest when heavily pregnant but is better than a bed installed with earthquake plates. I must've fallen asleep because at 4am I am awoken by all the lights suddenly being on and an almightly banging in the hallway and kitchen. The washing machine is also inexplicibly on and so obviously the whole living room/kitchen wall has decided to get in on the action and is being as loud as it can possibly be. I try and sleep through it for about 20 minutes before getting up to see what on earth is going on. DH is now fast asleep again, sprawled across the whole bed, but there is a massive stinking pile of poo on the hallway carpet, with splatters leading in to the kitchen. The bathtub is FULL of what I can only describe as poo-confetti. Everything stinks. It's not diarrhea- I'd be a little more understanding of that- but actual solid poo. Now I'm awake (as are, unfortunately, my nostrils) I can't get back to sleep. My back and legs are killing me from sitting/lying on the sofa but absolutely no way do I want to get back in to bed with him (doubt he'd even make room) and I am refusing to clean up on principle but the whole downstairs utterly reeks. He won't clean up- he's still totally incoherent and is refusing to move out of bed. So now I'm sat here on the sofa, in pain and furious, unable to sleep. What on earth do I do now? I've nowhere to go without a 2+ hour drive which I'm too tired for. What on earth do I do when he wakes up/what is an appropriate punishment/way for him to make up for this? Utterly grossed out and fuming."
"My neighbour is showing all the signs of being a PITA","All v minor at the moment but a faint alarm bell is starting to ring and I wonder if IABU. Moved house in January (detached house but in a busy, built up bit of London). This neighbour lives next door. Came to introduce herself and told us that she’d lived here for 20 years and that it was a very peaceful area <hard stare>. Peaceful. Just kept reiterating it. It isn’t a particularly peaceful area (we moved from two minutes away), but I got the message. We were about to start building works but I apologised for any noise and explained we’d do our best to minimise disruption. At some point she seemed to think we were away (we weren’t, our car was) and started parking across our garage. After the second day of this I left a note on the car - “Hey neighbour, please don’t block our garage - we need access for our works. Thanks!” The blocking stops, but she started to park so close to the garage that it’s practically quite difficult to use. I don’t say anything. A month passes. She knocks on our door and says, “You know that note you left on my car? Well your builder is blocking me in” and points to a van that I’ve never seen before. I explain that our builder has a van with his logo all over it and I have no idea whose van that is but it isn’t ours/our trademens’. She glares at me for a few minutes while I talk and then stomps off, no apology. She stops parking badly though. Today she knocked again. Our builder threw a dismantled shed away, and in doing so revealed a missing fence panel between our houses. She’s not happy and wants it replaced. (To be clear our builder didn’t detach anything- the bit of shed wall had just hidden the missing bit of fence from our side, but would always have been obvious to her.) I agreed without thinking too much - the builder is here anyway and it’s two minutes’ work, plus she is, above stuff aside, putting up with about four months and counting of hammering, drilling etc and I don’t want to be petty. But now I’m thinking about this and getting a bit grumpy. It’s her fence afaics (as in, she has the face of it). The missing panel isn’t my problem. And I’m getting pain the ass vibes. Wwyd? I’m minded to swallow this but then be rather less accommodating with whatever the next thing is."
"Weird friendship situation","I'm looking for advice/ thoughts from anyone who's been in the middle of a weird friendship triangle. We're all middle-aged, although it may not seem so. Basically a couple of years ago I became really good friends with someone who has another, main long-term friend (LTF) . Apparently LTF feels insecure about our mutual friend being friends with other people, and at the moment, specifically me. I'm in the middle feeling like an affair partner over middle-aged friendships where mutual friend would ideally not mention to LTF that she's been out with me etc or she feels guilty when talking about mutual friend and I spending time together. Stuff that for a game of soldiers. Unfortunately though mutual friend is someone I really enjoy spending time with, but I feel like walking away. LTF (who I don't know) apparently has bad anxiety and depression. Mutual friend is not very assertive / ignoring the situation. Had anyone else been in a similar situation? Wwyd?"
"No LTB please","Hi. I can't believe I'm writing this but here goes. Please, if anyone has LTB to say, just move on. I just found out my husband has had sex with prostitutes 3 times over 5 years whilst working away on Bangkok. We have 1 child. We currently live abroad for his work. I do not want to LTB right now because i can't accept my child will live a divorced parent life across two countries which is what I lived though. Did I mention I just had failed ivf for no2? I honestly believe he has some sort of compulsive sex addiction type problem. What he did DISGUSTS and REVOLTS me. Equally, I am concerned for his safety he is so fearful of losing us I'm worried what he will do to himself. Is there ever any moving on from this? I am in a state of shock, unable to process all this as having to hold it together for DC. For now I have said I'll give myself a month to digest what the actual fuck just happened before I make any decisions."
"To scream.........","<SCREAM>>>>>>>> The DC have only been back a week and I already feel overwhelmed. Back to work (although I don't even work FT, 25 hours a week), long commute to work, drop DC off and pick up, orthodontist appointments, parents evenings, cook, clean, laundry, dog walk, elderly parents and more... I'm already overwhelmed and knackered. My house is an absolute TIP. Anyone else just wants to SCREAM!!!!!"
"Came F2F with AP 16 years on","Apologies in advance because I am very tired and don't know how long I will be online tonight. So as background, husband had an affair 16 years ago. We worked through it but it has changed the whole dynamic of our relationship. However, I love him to bits. PLUS I am very menopausal and 'not on an even emotional keel' at the moment. Last night, we went to a party for DH's friend. I had a bit too much to drink. Thing is that the AP was there. Not sure if it was an oversight by the host or she had forgotten. I spent an hour or so in blissful ignorance and then realised who she was. Just went into myself (and probably had an extra glass of wine or so). Husband showed no reaction last night. This morning he was moaning at me for drinking too much. Finally I spoke to him after dinner about how uncomfortable I felt and he has: asked if that was an excuse for me drinking too much asked me why I came at all I didn't exactly cover myself in glory, but I was so shocked and now am dealing with a husband who is deflecting all the blame. And BTW, before you all say LTB and he's still having an affair, I will not be doing the former and he is certainly not doing the latter."
"Delayed divorce for a ltb","Any one else delaying divorce from a ltb to get themselves in a better financial position ? Trust me he doesn’t deserve the sympathy if anyone wants to inform me I’m wasting his time!….. he’s wasted 25 years of my life!…. 18 months and counting …"
"Holiday accommodation & DD","Before I roll out my picnic blanket to sit on the proverbial hill I’m choosing to metaphorically die on, AIBU? We’re going away on holiday with extended family in June. Accommodation is a large villa with additional connected apartments, but with separate entrances. There’s also a pool which is unfenced. Current proposal is that those with young kids (<3) take the apartments, thus ring fencing the kerfuffle at 6:30am when they all wake up, and letting those in the main house get a bit of a holiday lie in. I have said, OK, makes sense but obviously either DH or I will effectively go to bed with DD (2) each night because I don’t want to leave her by herself in a different building (separate entrances) with potential hazards around (unfenced pool, one apt is up stone steps with a balcony, what if the air con catches fire). According to the in-laws, I’m being TOTALLY unreasonable, PFB-esque, nothing will happen to her, just lock all of the doors so she can’t get out, it’s no different to her being asleep upstairs in the house, I’m creating a rod for my own back, just whack on a baby monitor, blah blah blah. So, AIBU? Should I chill out, take the monitor, hope it stretches and enjoy my evenings in the main villa? Or AINBU and leaving a 2 year old asleep locked in a different building isn’t really OK?"
"Confused on the concept of non binary","Please be nice, i am not the sharpest knife in the box under normal circumstances and I'm running on about 6 hrs sleep over the past week at the minute..... But something I've been trying and failing to understand re. the concept of 'non binary' in the 'gender movement' (or whatever it is/ought to be called) is that on the one hand, people who subscribe to that philosophy are saying they reject the traditional idea of explicit male/femaleness (because if ""trans women are women"" then they have swapped for instance). But then if you have 'non binary' individuals isn't that pretty much saying oh yes, actually there is a binary - and some people don't subscribe to it? I do acknowledge sex =/= gender but not all NB people are intersex/have DSD <<thoroughly discombobulated>>"
"Consent issue. Spanish footballer vs her federation's president.","I'm really impressed with Jenni Hermoso's No Shit Tolerated attitude on this. Says she did not consent to be forcibly grabbed by the head and kissed full on the mouth (bleurgh) by Spanish football federation president Luis Rubiales. He dismissed it as an exuberant, celebratory 'peck'. Apparently her complaint is ""false feminism"" and an undeserved ""social assassination"" of his character. <sigh> 🙄 https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U6C6qPpoG6I (Independent Sport evidence clip) [Real charmer. He also pointed at the players then grabbed his crotch as Spain won. Standing next to the Queen and her 16-year-old daughter. Classy]. 81 players confirm they will not play for Spain's women's team until he is removed from his post. Good for them. Hermoso released a long statement on social media: ""I want to make clear that at no time did the conversation to which Mr Luis Rubiales refers to in his address take place and, above all, was his kiss ever consensual."" She added his claims were ""categorically false and part of the manipulative culture that he has generated"". ""I feel the need to report this incident because I believe no person, in any work, sports or social setting should be a victim of these types of non-consensual behaviours. I felt vulnerable and a victim of impulsive-driven, sexist, out-of-place act, without any consent on my part,"" she continued. ""Quite simply, I was not respected."" She added that she was put ""under continuous pressure"" to help with a ""statement that could justify"" Rubiales' actions - and so were her family, friends and team-mates. England's Lionesses backed her immediately. Yay them. Their official statement: “Unacceptable actions allowed to happen by a sexist and patriarchal organisation. Abuse is abuse and we have all seen the truth. “The behaviour of those who think they are invincible must not be tolerated and people shouldn’t need convincing to take action against any form of harassment.

"To put 4 and a half month old to sleep alone?","I know the official advice is to keep them with you until they are 6 months. But DD does sleep with me but she goes to sleep at 7. Until recently we had her in the lounge with us but we kept her up talking and with the TV. So she’s in the bedside cot upstairs. It’s OK right … <goes to check again>"
"Jigsaws - what sort of psychopath does a jigsaw","And doesn't start with the edges? DH has started our new one and is randomly putting middle pieces together. AIBU to LTB immediately and fill in the sectioning paperwork. Removing the poll as there is obviously no-one sane who would vote against me. Lightheated btw."
"Oversensitive or being gaslighted/manipulated?","Honestly, I am taking up so much head space on this that I need some others perspectives on my DH behaviour (and I guess mine). LTR 25+ years and DC nearly all left home. I feel like I need to reclaim ""me"" at this point in my life and am feed up of biting my tongue and not expressing my wants. This sits alongside my DH who I think tries to control me with his behaviours. If I try to challenge him on them (calmly standing my ground not arguments) he will either say I am over sensitive, get angry, or play poor little me victim. Here's some examples. I've been out the last 2 nights, went out earlier in the day, back by 9/9.30pm. I've had for days ""I'll be so lonely, I'm all by myself again...do I actually get to spend a night in with you tonight (this morning). This makes me feel guilty and angry at the same time - but if I challenge him I will be told he is ""just joking"" (a lot of his ""jokes"" are poor old me/nobody loves me based), or that I am oversensitive and my moods are ""all over the place"" since perimenopause (to a degree true - but I feel that the real thing that has changed is I no longer bit my tongue like I used to). He takes a packed lunch to work. Never makes the childrens or my lunches. But will invariably start getting ready for work and say ""I suppose I have to make my own lunch...."" waiting for me to offer. If it is a school day I will do it automatically as I am already making one, but I really hate that he tries to make me feel guilty and do it when it is not a school day (and even more frustrated with myself that I do it quite a lot when he guilt trips me - sometimes I make an excuse to leave the house early to avoid this!). A real bone of contention is the bath. I know this sounds bat-shit crazy. He likes to share bath water - he prefers a bath, thinks it saves water if we share (one after the other - not together!). This has been going on for a while where he will ask ""when are we bathing?"" and gets shitty if I say I want to shower (I much prefer a shower 80% of the time). He will guilt trip me (""I'm just trying to save water"" "" I will just strip wash then""... refuses to shower as he ""doesn't like a shower, likes a bath). Because we used to do this when the kids were small he doesn't see why we need to change. So these are all ""small"" things - we have both always had our own trips away, hobbies, independence etc - but I could give you 100's of examples of other little manipulations. It is wearing me down and I want to scream inside. For context, other people from the outside would see us as a perfect couple. He would say he always supports me - I feel like this is only true when I am being the version of me he wants, and our life behind doors is not what people would think. He is very lovely and complimentary - but I would say a bit love bombing (and again there is lots of guilt tripping wrapped up in this. We live a relatively comfortable life. I am the main bread winner, he has had lots of part-time or no jobs over the years (and some full time), but I also do all life admin, kids etc. He thinks he is hard done by. I don't know if I am making a mountain out of a molehill about things that I should get over, or deal with better. I need to find a way to get over my fear and tackle this - so I can see if it improves or shows me I need to leave. How do i start?"
"How to deal with kink taking over","My husband and I have a really close relationship and have spoken about all of the desires we had not previously felt able to share in other relationships. He likes the idea of me touching him with silky underwear and also has a massive tights/stocking fetish. I am fine with this in small doses but it is every time now! He will go to my underwear drawer to fetch a pair of my nice pants to wank with which I have asked him not to do. He goes on and on about seeing me in tights and stockings - I am flattered he finds me so appealing when dressed up. On the other hand I want to just have regular sex and be enough without the accessories if you see what I mean. I do not want to kink shame him and have tried (very clumsily) asking that we just have 'normal' sex. I feel a bit awful that I am responsible for his sexual liberation and now want him to tone it down. What do I do? Please bore off the prudish ltb Mumsnet group! I could do with some sisterly advice about how to phrase an opening conversation. Thanks"
"Husband sneaky behaviour with female coworkers","I need advice. Married 11 years, had some things happen in that time which has really questioned my husbands faithfulness. 3 months after marrying, he spent time with an ex girlfriend whom he met while on a night out. Lied to me when he got home pissed at 5.30 saying he was at his friends house. I had a really bad feeling so I checked his phone and his friend had messaged and called several times reminding him he's married and to please go home. He got in a cab with her and went to her home. He pleaded and said nothing happened. I took him back wanting my new marriage to work. Fast forward, mentioned a coworker a lot, made my senses go up for some reason. She worked in neighbouring city, so didn't see each other too much. But, here's the thing. She had a friend living in out town who she'd regularly come to go for drinks with, and each time she would message my husband and send pouty selfies saying come on it'll be fun bla bla. I found these messages when one night they were away at a work function and he went for dinner and drinks with her, despite loads of coworkers being in the same hotel. I flipped to be honest and demanded to see his work phone. They communicated a lot, a lot of flirty undertones from her, not from him, but he didn't shoot it down either. He had a message from her that night at about 11 saying wellllllll???? Said it was to get his room number to sort the dinner bill. I swallowed it hook line and sinker. Anyway, laid my cards on the table and gave very clear expectations of my boundaries. He agreed and I tried to forget about it. Soon after he bad mouthed her a lot, initially she was the best thing since sliced bread, suddenly not so much. Strange I thought. Then, all good I thought. But we'd a case of mentioning another coworker. They had same role in different parts of the country, both with the company over 15 years. I'd never heard him talk of her before. So, she gets a new role and they had to launch a pilot project. Of course had to communicate a lot for it, totally understandable. But the mentionitis got me on alert. Both working from home one day and she called, he went to another room to take the call and they just seemed so so comfortable talking to each other. No work talk, all just shooting the shit. It just made me feel uncomfortable. Anyway, they launched the project, had no reason to be communicating for work anymore. Yet it turns out they were speaking almost every day and sometimes up to 3 times a day, convos usually at least 25 minutes at a time. I won't lie I'm not proud, I checked his work phone and that's how I found out. They messaged a lot too, lots of her saying how much she'd miss him when they launched the pilot. I kept an eye on call log for a few weeks, and all of a sudden no calls. So brought her up in roundabout way and pushed for info. He eventually said ah we don't speak all that much anymore, she got pissy one day apparently so he pulled away. Really, wtaf. Sounds to me like it was something of an emotional affair? Then recently he was away for Christmas party, he wasn't drinking as working the next day, so he drove home after (2.5 hour journey). Anyway, when he got home he went straight to loo, his work phone beeped so I had a quick look and it was from her to check he got home ok. Now bare in mind she would have been drinking several hours at that stage, so why the f<ck was she thinking of my husband. Then, he had to employ an assistant. She wasn't in the business long but he promoted her. Anyway, went to meet him for lunch, and we'll fuck me I almost passed out when I saw her. Early 30s,lips done, botox done, fillers, you name it. Each to their own.... However, he breasts were out, and 8 mean out out, like going clubbing out. I just thought wow, is that whu he employed someone with fuck all experience. I was honest and said I'm not comfortable with someone having their tits out around him all day. My hat off to any woman who says it wouldn't bother her! Anyway, he has since gotten a new position wfh. The thing is, I went to call his sister from his phone today and noticed he has deleted this girls number (same name as his sis). So I quickly checked his work phone, numbers gone and also whatsapp deleted. I don't understand. They need to be in contact with each other for work, so how can he do that without her number. And why the hell would he delete it?? Am I going crazy, please be honest"
"to try and explain why nursery fees are so high","I opened a nursery two years ago, in an area that desperately needed one. It was all over the local papers at the time about the local childcare crisis, and families were having to relocate etc. I thought I was doing a nice thing. Since I've opened, I get weekly - sometimes daily - criticism and occasionally abuse about the ""extortionate"" fees we charge. I've been called a filthy capitalist, a con-artist and endure many, many comments about ""printing money"" etc. I cannot comment IRL, I'm in a closed community that would deliberately misunderstand and I'd get even more flack. So please allow me my vent. Childcare ratios are as follows: For every 3 children under 2 years old, we require 1 staff member. 2 - 3 year olds is 4 children to 1 staff. Over 3s is 8 children to 1 staff. 50% of staff must be qualified at all times - that's a Level 3 childcare diploma or higher, which is typically 2 years of college study. I've done it myself very recently and whilst it isn't ""hard"", it is extraordinarily detailed, long and - frankly - dull. I pay our Manager £13.50ph, Deputy £13.00ph and all other staff £12.50ph. Excluding employer's contributions. We pay well for the industry, which is typically minimum wage (£10.42ph) - our salaries are reflective of our less than popular area. All staff are legally obligated to attend a 2 hour long training session run by the local council 4 times a year, with our SENCO and DSL staff required to attend additional specialised sessions again. It is expected - at a legislative level - that each staff member does an additional 20+ hours of CPD a year. It is also mandatory to have a monthly staff meeting (so add 1 hour extra per staff member each month), and a monthly supervision meeting per staff member (so 2 hours for Manager + staff member). We obviously have to pay staff to open the nursery 30 minutes before children arrive, and they stay for roughly 1 hour after children have left to complete paperwork, clean and lay out activities for the following day. The Manager needs 10+ hours a week on top of the time she spends with children for more paperwork than God himself needs to complete. She only gets away with 10 hours a week because I do the majority of the heavy stuff, for free. I have calculated, roughly, that for every hour a child is in the nursery - it ""costs"" us 1.4 hours of labour, when including the above. A minimum of 2 staff must be on site at all times, meaning that the staffing cost per hour is at a minimum of £35 per childcare hour (taking into consideration the training etc.) If those 2 staff are taking Under 2s (2 staff = 6 babies) - that brings the cost per baby to £5.83ph 2 - 3 year olds would be £4.38ph Over 3s would be £2.19ph This is, of course, assuming that there are the maximum number of children per staff member - which is rarely the case. This does not include - surplus staff for illness, lunches, outings and annual leave. Overhead costs such as electricity (for us this is roughly £400 a month in Summer), rent and business rates. I don't really know what I'm trying to achieve here but honestly, I'm going insane. All I seem to see online is people complaining about the cost of childcare, and I know that it is often directed at the gov, but it's also often directed at Nursery owners and I really don't think people have sat down and looked at the maths. Setting up this nursery cost £75k, and I was doing it on a tight budget with family doing a lot of the renovation. I have never drawn a salary, and in fact subsidise it by several thousand a month with a full time job. (Yes, I'm considering closing it - but I know it will make me even less popular in town). Rant over. Congrats if you've read all the way though <3"
"Feelings for coworker who’s in a LTR?","Hello all I have worked at my current place for 9 months. There is a man there whom I have grown close to, and we both feel a lot of chemistry and connection with each other. I’m approaching my mid 30s, he’s in his late 40’s. However, a significant obstacle is that this man has been with his partner for 16 years (who’s a few years older than him), “living in sin” as he describes it, and they have a 13-Yr-old son. I have never dated or have ever tried to date a man who is taken. But this is a situation where the chemistry is very strong, and I have grown quite attached to him. I have tried to keep distance between us, but our good connection has always won us over and we’ve often resorted to enjoying it. This man and I haven’t spent time alone together outside work, but I feel like we are getting to the stage where he might ask me to go for a drink or something. I would really want to. I am wondering whether anyone on here has been in this situation before? Also I know that this thread is on a controversial topic. I would please request that posters don’t aim to scold or judge me; I normally have a strong moral compass and this is just an exceptional situation for me where I have developed feelings against my better judgement. I would really like some help and advice. With thanks in advance 🌸"
"Husband has walked out","I had a thread on here last year about DH growing distant and then me discovering his 4 month affair. He never actually met her, but planned to, and had given her significant amounts of our savings and told her he loves her / sexted her etc. There’s other stuff too, but that’s the nutshell. We have had extensive counselling, both together and apart. I decided to stay together but my concern was would he be able to sustain the effort it would take to support me getting over this. in the most part, I would say our relationship has never been stronger. Dh has done so much work with his counsellor and also in marriage counselling. I have full access to his phone, he’s changed his number etc. it’s been the hardest thing I’ve ever done. At the time I contacted another woman he had been messaging. There was 4 in total. She only read the message this week (Facebook) and replied with a load of abuse but basically denying everything that DH already had admitted too. This has massively upset me, raked Everything up, and whilst I’m trying very hard I’ve struggled this week not to feel gutted and then angry again. me and DH had a fight earlier about something unconnected. I told him I was so angry with him, that I hated him. He replied he hated me too, that I was always woe is me, that he’s had enough. He’s driven off, and I (stupidly) took all the money out the joint account. On realising this, he has messaged me to say I’m a horrible person and he hates me…… so far, so bloody awful. I’m struggling. We have been doing so well, but this has thrown me back to feeling like I did in the beginning - but DH seems resentful of this. I know I’m horrible saying I hated him, but god I’m so over feeling this way. I hate what he did, and I hate his feeling now that I need to get over it and they I’m playing the victim when it hurts. I’m doing so much better, but I can’t heal fast enough. Him saying he hates me too - I feel so angry, like why? All I’ve bloody done is stay by his side and try get over this and love him. i know mumsnet always seems LTB, but I don’t know if I’m ready for that yet. He may be at that point of walking away though. What do I do? Tell me how to feel better and get through this please. My sons upstairs and I’m trying so hard to hold this all together"
"To ask why my DH never listens to me…","Just that really. There are areas of life where I have more skill, experience or knowledge than him and vice versa. If I share advice I’m nagging, micro managing and he always gets annoyed. He literally will argue against my advice - even when it’s bloody obvious I’m right. If he shares advice he’s helping and if I don’t agree or don’t listen he gets angry about it. I’m arrogant and not listening. He shares A LOT of unsolicited advice. Really obvious stuff too. Mainly needed to vent but also wondering if other people get this too? Any strategies? I sometimes just let him fail but this often then has knock on consequences for me. One example is I’m much better than him at judging how long something will take. Recently we needed to be somewhere by a certain time. We needed to leave in the next five minutes. It was crucial to be there on time. He started to put the kettle on and make a sandwich. I said we haven’t got time to do that. Conversation then went; DH ‘we have got time for a quick cup of tea’ me; ‘we really haven’t, we need to leave in five minutes maximum’ DH ‘It will be fine’ Me; ‘it’s x o’clock now and it takes x amount of time to get there’ DH - frustrated and cross ‘No, it will be fine, I’ve got time for a cup of tea, I’ve been at work all day.’ (He works less hours than me btw) me; ‘it’s x o’clock now, we need to be there by x o’clock, it takes x amount of time and we need to find parking and walk to venue’ DH ‘It won’t take that long’ me: ‘I think it will and I don’t want to be late so I’m going now. You can take the other car and join me’ I put my shoes and coat on, grabbed the car key and headed out. He then quickly stopped making a cup of tea got his coat and came with me and we arrived JUST in time, exactly when I knew we would. No sorry. No ‘you were right’. No LTB please. It may well come to that (for many reasons) but for now I’m stuck with him."
"DH threatened to punch my son","I need to get this out, I think I know what I am going to do but welcome opinions and people’s experiences of similar situation. will try to get as much information in one go: Married to my DH for 12 years, have a son with moderate MH issues from previous LTR. DS is 18 and living with us. In general, DH and DS get on ok. No other children. Yesterday, DS and DH had a bad argument about a relatively minor thing. DS got upset and was almost crying and said ‘mum, divorce him!’ DH got absolutely furious and said to my son that if he ever says it again, he will punch him in the face. DH is normally a v easygoing guy, never violent although will have ocasional temper flare-ups. But yesterday he was a completely different person, I was really concerned. He also made a v cruel comment to my son referring to his MH issues. That was not in the heat of the moment. It was calculated, cruel and below the belt. DS physically recoiled from it. DH apologised to him later but the damage has been done. Today DS didn’t go to college as was feeling down and couldn’t focus. DH has known DS since DS was 10, knows his med history and his challenges. We’ve had a rough couple of years after I discovered he cheated on me (escorts while on business trips), and frankly I have been thinking about divorcing him more and more as 2 years on I still feel disgusted by him. I stayed in the immediate aftermath as didn’t want to cause disturbance for DS at the time. And I get on really well with DH’s parents who treat DS like their own grandchild despite having 7 blood grandchildren. I am financially independent so no concerns on this side. Also DS spends half the week with his dad so it’s not like he’s a ‘burden’ on DH. I’m in my mid 50s, generally healthy with a good group of friends around me. I know I would be happier without DH so why can’t I just leave? Edited"
"to think we can't go to an evening wedding reception with newborn","We've been invited to an evening wedding reception. They are actually already married (got married fairly quickly abroad for visa reasons) but are having a reception/celebration this summer. It doesn't start until 7:30 and it's a fair distance from where we live (3 hour drive) so would probably mean an overnight hotel stay, and we will have a newborn (<2 months old). AIBU to think this is just a no-go? DH thinks it will be do-able, but I am just not sure I will be up to it, and I think managing a tiny baby in the car, at the reception and overnight in a hotel will be tricky!"
"Don't want to do nude selfies for my DH","So... long history of this. I won't bore you all but my DH has always had a thing about sexting and nude pics etc (to be clear - with me!). I hate it. There is a bit of an odd dynamic in our relationship, with him having had to give up work years ago because of a disability and at one point me really resenting a massive commute (no chance of us moving nearer to my work, oh no...) and also being furious that he would pester and pester and pester me for sexts on my train journeys. Anyway, lots of other stuff - coercive stuff around sex, really unhealthy - and back in 2016 I actually ended up exploring getting a divorce. Selfishly, though, when my solicitor told me I'd be unlikely to get a clean break, and would have to pay him maintenance for life, I backed out and decided to try to fix things as best I could. At the time I was drinking quite a bit (but never missed work or anything) and he threatened to use my ""alcoholism"" against me in the divorce to make sure I wouldn't get custody of ""his"" (our) children. So now he does what chores he can manage (he used to do nothing) and we rub along ok. And I gave up alcohol completely almost four years ago, so there's that. Anyway, I am on a short break away with my eldest DD (for uni) and my DH kept on and on and ON at me for a nude pic. I almost did it this morning and then something in me rebelled and I said ""no"". He is now furious!! I know everyone will likely say ""LTB"" - esp as my children are now much older - 14 and almost 18 - but the lawyer I saw that time made it sound so clear that I would have to support him - forever - as he can't work. And I can't stomach that. FFS how did I get into such a dreadful mess? I was a totally committed feminist in my younger days and yet this has crept up on me. And the worst of it? I feel bad for standing up for myself!!! 😮WTF is that all about?! AIBU to expect him to understand that I hate taking pics of myself (full stop - but especially) naked?"
"To think this is shitty and snobbish","I have two close friends, A and B. I have known A for decades (since we were teenagers). Have known B for less time, but she's a solid friend and we all get on well and go out sometimes. A has been in a LTR with a bloke for decades (20+ years): they have three kids, very settled. He's nice enough, a great dad but I've always thought he's a bit of a snob and that may be colouring my judgement. B is in a relatively new relationship (coming up to two years) after a horrible divorce. A's other half has developed an intense and apparently irrational dislike of B's other half. As far as I can tell this is purely based on snobbery. B's other half is not the world's most charismatic person, not a sparkling conversationalist. He's quiet and kind of awkward and struggles to read a room but is always polite and respectful and is as far as we can tell kind, decent and generous. B seems happy with him. A has been having an issue with some work stuff and B's partner (they work in the same industry) was helping her with it, at A's request. B's partner was doing this unpaid and has gone round to help her with it a couple of weekends running (never alone, other people and family have always been there so no suggestion any cheating or flirting has occurred). A has said she is hugely grateful to B's boyfriend and asked B if she could him a gift to thank him. B suggested buying him dinner and drinks and tried to find a date for us all to go out (including me and my DP and our kids). A flapped for a bit and changed the subject. A told me later in private after B and her partner had gone that she couldn't do that to her partner because her partner finds B's partner ""hilariously dull"" and couldn't sit in a pub or a restaurant with him for an hour without ""exploding with boredom"". I thought that was really shitty. B's partner can be a bit dull sometimes but it costs nothing to sit and have a drink with him. Particularly as he's done a favour for A. Unless I'm missing some private issue between these two blokes (I'm pretty sure I'm not because they've only met about four times), I think this is just A's partner being a nasty snob. Everyone's entitled to choose their friends and there's no reason A's partner and B's partner need to be great mates, but not being able to be superficially friendly to someone who's done your family a favour over a drink just seems so rude. Of course A can just buy a present and give it to B's partner (which is probably what will happen). But the idea that A's partner thinks he can just walk out of rooms every time B's partner is present and completely avoid him, causing embarrassment to his family, just because he finds the bloke a bit boring, seems so entitled to me."
"Is DD in a bizarre controlling relationship?","I am close to my DD21 she still lives at home. She has some mild additional needs that affected her as a child but she has a job, car, friends etc, she’s independent. Now my DC are adults I am more of a relaxed parent who likes to give them trust and respect. I ask them to tell me their vague plans or whereabouts so I know they are ok, but I do trust DD she’s sensible. Like they don’t have wild parties when I’m not home or anything. My house is also open to their friends or partners. I am worried about her and am trying to be supportive so not to alienate her. For background DD sees her dad a lot but he is not a very good dad, we separated when she was little as he is controlling and he doesn’t treat his DC very well. He’s not emotionally available and he has high expectations of the DC and they don’t like to do anything that doesn’t please him. I left him because I was very young and vulnerable but I realised he was not a good man but he’s just a good enough dad (the basics - present in their lives). DD always wanted a RS with him so I facilitated it whilst working on her self esteem to try to not let history repeat itself. I feel like I’ve failed. DD is in a LTR with someone her own age she has known for many years - so both adults. Ive struggled to warm to him, but he’s welcome at our house and I do try to get to know him. His parents are apparently so bizarrely controlling that I can see how badly it affects my DD. They control when he sees DD, all his money, time, car, whereabouts so she ends up driving him around everywhere and all they can do is see each other for a couple of hours now and then. DD and her BF argue about his parents constantly. She is unhappy with the situation but won’t give up on him because she thinks it’s not his fault - but to see him, she has to check with his MUM. He also has a curfew before it gets dark. They also crash all their free time so any date event DD arranges with her BF, the parents invite themselves along, and even sometimes have forced DD into doing something completely different that they want to do! DD is allowed to stay at their house (not same room) but isn’t a big fan of them obviously, so she’s always trying to get her BF to go do things, like dinner and cinema but his mum will decide if he's allowed to go! When she gets upset with him, DD told me he responds to her to tell her that it’s a ‘respect thing’ and DD has to talk to his parents about it if it’s bothering her! If I express any frustration when DD confides in me she gets really upset about it. IMO it is absolutely ridiculous and I don’t know why either of them are putting up with this nonsense but she is young and this is her first real relationship. AIBU? I feel sorry for the BF having these loony parents but this has all the hallmarks of future PIL from hell doesn’t it?"

"Do parents stay at school discos?","DD’s first ever school disco tomorrow. It is her first term in Reception. We’ve bought her a ticket, tickets are sold per child. It is in the evening, so will pick up from school, come home and have tea (and dress up in a sparkly dress) then go back to school for the disco. I assumed that we would leave the children there and come back to pick up. It is a supervised event and a small school (<100 pupils). But now the class WhatsApp is lighting up with all the other parents saying they are staying at school for the whole duration. From my memories of school discos in the 90’s, parents don’t stay?? Unless there was some secret parent room somewhere that I didn’t know about 😂. I had already told DD that the disco was just for children and parents aren’t allowed, now I’m alternating between thinking I’m a terrible person for leaving her there when all the other parents are staying, and thinking if you didn’t think your child could be happy going to such an event, why did you buy a ticket? AIBU to drop her off and pick her up at the specified times?"
"What irritates you about other people?","I get really irritated when someone won’t accept “I don’t know” as my answer. Something along the lines of: ”Sarah is having a baby! Do you know when it’s due?” ”No, I didn’t know she was pregnant” ”Her oldest is four and she didn’t want a big age gap so it’s probably soon” <Looks at me expectantly> ”I didn’t know she was pregnant so no idea I’m afraid” ”But when do you think it would be?” <Looks at me expectantly> ”Still no idea. Between now and six months?!?” Or ”I need to hire a nanny. How do you recruit a nanny?” ”I don’t have a nanny so couldn’t say. Have you talked to Sarah, she will probably know?” ”I should probably talk to a nanny agency, which one should I call?” ”I’ve never hired a nanny through an agency so no idea I’m afraid” ”But you must have some idea!” It has to be okay to sometimes just say “I dunno”."
"Is he the problem and if he is, what can I do to help our relationship","TLDR - DH an absolute arse when we argue but perfect in all other areas. Should I put up with it? We've been together for three years. Had a bumpy start but got ourselves sorted. Looking back, I think the foundations were laid then around the way we argue and now we can't undo it and I'm worried that I am staying in a really unhealthy relationship. About 80% of the time, we have a great relationship. We are supportive of one another, respectful, good partnership and get on well. However, if we have an argument, it goes down hill, and fast! Today was the latest example. Did all the back to school stuff, was quite a nice day (no kids with us) and popped by McDonalds drive thru on the way home. Driving out, DH put his foot on the brake and a load of chips ended up on the floor. I said “FFS” (loudly) as was annoyed by the mess and made an ill judged poke at him for braking when he did (obviously braking can’t be helped). Really wasn’t anything major and was simply a reaction to a situation but still, wasn’t his fault and so not fair of me. Anyway, I asked him to pull over so I could clean up and he said no. He said he was driving and he would make the decisions and that it was my fault for “throwing” the chips on the floor. This then escalated beyond all recognition with him shouting that he was right about everything (yes - literally). Told me that I had “started it” by shouting at him and told me it was completely my fault and I should apologise and that he would keep shouting until I did. So in and of itself, that’s a stupid argument where had I just said sorry and cleared up it would have gone away. Problem is, he gets so verbally aggressive and so shouty and dominant and entirely unwilling to accept that there would be another way of looking at things and it’s all so QUICK that I start to cry. And then I get told things like I’m pathetic and that I need to stop “whimpering”. And I KNOW this isn’t ok. The only reason I am crying is because I have had my voice taken from me and I am now completely overwhelmed. I genuinely don’t know if I need to change some of my behaviour because I’m nitpicking or if he is the one who is unreasonable. All our arguments are like this. They start off over tiny, inconsequential things, escalate to boiling point very quickly and then I get dominated and cry. BUT (importantly) most of the arguments are started by me. I suppose I need to know if there is anything I can change and that it is reasonable for me to change or if it is just a bad idea to be in this relationship. And to the LTB tribe - I hear you. But what I am genuinely interested in is whether there is an alternative way for me to manage these outbursts to support some more continuous harmony!"
"Angry about CM","My ex & I separated 13 months ago, we weren’t married & have 1 child together. I have asked him to sort maintenance privately which he was fine with & paid £300 a month however it was sporadic so I thought it best to go through official lines so CMS..he is a Director of a a Ltd company & draws down no dividends, wages or shares so now DWP have told me that he can pay zero. I asked DWP to check his Ltd company as he earns a lot of money but because there is no individual tax payment they cannot pursue it as a Ltd company is an individual tax entity so cannot do anything about it. I explained this to him & he said oh well maybe you should have been happy before..can I do anything?"
"To hate the school run?","Nothing to do with the usual reasons people hate it, like disliking small talk or playground cliques. I hate the school run because of my own “D”C! They are so difficult to get to school, it’s less than a mile but they’re both terrible walkers so it’s scooters or bikes. If DS1 is in a good mood he’s no problem, but if he’s not he will be rude to me and wind DS2 (5) up. DS2 is just a nightmare. He’s too tired, his legs hurt, his knees hurt, his hands hurts. His bike is too small for him, it’s too hard. DS1 has gone on ahead and not waiting for him, how dare he. A classmate dared pass him by on their bike/scooter because they’re going faster. It’s not low level whinging which I would ignore, it’s full shouting, losing temper (he has anger issues and anything sets him off), stopping in the middle of the road. I then have to somehow get him the rest of the way. It is so tempting to just drive every day. Driving is a pain, large catchment so lots of parents drive, and local residents get really angry at the cars parked around, and we still have to walk from the car which with DS2 can take longer than the <5 minutes it should. Plus we live about 0.8 miles away. But the DC always behave in the car. AIBU? Do other people love the extra time with their DC in the morning? I rarely see other children behaving badly so it certainly feels like everyone else skips happily to school!"
"To crave sex and romantic relations with other men","Been in a LTR for 5 years. Lived together for 3. Both very good friends, however, I just do not want sex with my DP anymore. I could happily go without it and the thought of him touching me makes me sick, although he's very handsome, lovely body etc. He just doesn't turn me on anymore and I'm so stuck on what to do, because every other part of our relationship is good. I know the grass is never greener, but we've tried to fix this situation, we've spoke about it and it's been stagnant for 2 years now. Maybe have sex once a month. My eye is now wandering and I can't help but find other men attractive and want to pursue them. Leaving this relationship would mean losing my house and potentially having to move back home with my parents (yikes) and losing friends as I moved away from home and all of our friends are from his side. I feel like I would essentially lose everything/everyone. Never been in a situation like this before and it's killing me. I just want something else, but not sure if it's the infatuation of other people luring me in because my relationship is missing the sex/romance part. Any suggestions..."
"Please help me find some strength and figure out what to do","In August he physically hurt me. I called the police and he was bailed with conditions, but I eventually forgave him and dropped the charges. Since then he's been living apart from me and the kids and we've been working on our marriage and his issues. Things have been better over the last few weeks and he's been staying at the house with us a lot more, but it feels like every time I let my guard down and start to feel comfortable and safe, something bad happens. He's got better, but he has a tendency to overreact to even the slightest bit of negativity from me, either real or perceived, meaning that if I'm ever even slightly bad tempered, or stressed, or ill, or even if I disagree with him about something, he takes it really harshly and completely shuts down on me. He just totally closes off emotionally and seems to lack empathy. He'll walk away, leave the house, give me the silent treatment, threaten to leave me, block me etc. When things are good between us, he's loving and affectionate and reasonable and great fun to be around. But as soon as he detects any kind of negativity from me, he just withdraws and goes stone cold. Because of this, before August I felt like I was always on eggshells around him, worried about doing or saying the wrong thing and setting him off. We have 3 kids, the younger ones are 2 and almost 1. We're pretty much always tired and stressed and ill, so his reactions were a regular occurrence. We've been having counselling since August and he has been making an effort to change. He has improved in a lot of ways, but I just don't know if I can stay on this rollercoaster anymore. It's like things are fine one minute, and then we're on the verge of divorce again the next. Fast forward to today. I should say that the incident in August happened because I was really ill. He didn't believe me and he treated me horribly. This weekend, he was ill with a bad cold/covid type bug, meaning that I did the bulk of looking after the kids and house. But now I've caught it, and yet again he's just withdrawn on me. Yesterday I tried to power through and carry on as normal, but I could sense that he was withdrawing and being less affectionate towards me. This morning I woke up and felt absolutely awful. I could really have done with a day in bed. He took me asking him for help in the morning as a criticism, and when I asked if he could take some time off (he works flexibly) to do the school/nursery run so I could go back to bed instead of going out in the cold with the heavy double buggy, he refused and walked out of the house while I was crying and begging him to stay and help me. His reason was that he won't go to school or nursery because they know what he did in August, so it's too uncomfortable for him and the staff for him to go there. But both school and nursery have said they understand the situation and have no problem with him collecting/being around the children, so I don't really think that's a good enough reason. I feel like he should have put his pride to one side and cared more about his ill and struggling wife than the feelings of the nursery staff or random people on the school run. I'm so burnt out and exhausted on top of being ill and he knows that. I feel so let down by him, yet again. I think it's dawning on me that he's never going to be capable of being there for me when I need him, and that I have a lifetime of being let down by him when I need support, either physically or emotionally, if I stay with him. This is far from the first time he's been shit to me when I've been ill, and is part of a pattern of him shutting down and abandoning me when I become too needy for him to deal with or he feels 'attacked'. I keep thinking I deserve better than this. But I'm so scared. I'm scared of losing him when I love him so much. I'm scared of having to cope with 3 small kids on my own. I'm scared of being alone forever. I'm scared of the upheaval of separating and how I'd financially manage with 3 kids. I'm scared of regretting it and watching him move on and be happy with someone else. I'm scared of the stigma of being a single mum with kids from 2 different dads. I'm scared of making a mistake and ruining mine and my kids lives and futures. What on earth do I do? Do I keep working on things and hoping he'll change? I'm not perfect, I have my own faults and I'll admit I've been a bit of a mess since August. I think I'm dealing with some sort of trauma or having some kind of breakdown to be honest. I am trying to address it, but the kids are pretty all consuming at the moment, so it's difficult. I've been on Mumsnet for years so I know everyone will tell me to LTB. My family and friends have all told me to leave him. But I just don't feel strong enough. It's really not as easy as 'just leave' when it's your actual life. And I love him so much. I don't know what to think or do. Thank you if you've managed to read all of this. It's so long, I don't really expect anyone to. I just needed to write it all down."
"DH going away for few days","A bit of AIBU and WWYD. I’ll start by saying this is not a LTB situation. I have a very healthy and great relationship with my DH, he is an amazing dad and very involved and hands on. Now the issue: we have an 11 month old son, DH is on paternity leave and has been for the past 6 months. DS is normally a lovely baby to look after, sleeps well at night, but like any other baby he can have bad days and it’s hard work. DH is going away for 3 nights 4 days for a stag. I’m feeling very anxious about this as it would be just me and DS and an extremely needy puppy. We don’t have any family or friends to come help and provide a bit of help even for couple of hours. Even though DH is on leave, every month he has to go away for two days as part of his contract (unusual situation I won’t get into). Last time he did this, my mum came to help, but this time this is not possible. He will be going away again in couple weeks time. Work is different from a stag do so I have more understanding him going to work rather than to have fun. My work allows me to be flexible and wfh but I would still need to stop working and re arrange any work commitments, use some of my holiday and / or make up for time another days. Would it be unreasonable to ask him to cancel his stag do trip? Part of me doesn’t want to as I do want him to go have fun but the other part of me feels like this probably isn’t the best time for these type of trips. I will obviously talk to him about it but I just wanted to get a sense check. WWYD?"
"Question for English teachers","This is something that’s been bugging me since I was at secondary school. WHY are so many of the set texts so bloody depressing? When I was at school (mid to late 80s) we did A Kestrel for a Knave which was pretty tragic swiftly followed by Z for Zachariah which was utterly terrifying. They were no fun AT ALL to real and tbh I’m still a bit traumatised <dramatic>. My DS is 13 and has just finished The Boy in The Striped Pyjamas and they’ve now moved onto A Monster Calls. He’s quite a sensitive boy and he’s really not liking the second one at all, especially as a family friend recently died of cancer in her mid 40s. Obviously I understand that they need to explore different themes and life isn’t all jolly but AIBU that maybe a few cheerful books might encourage them to read a bit more rather than DOOOOOOOMMMMM?? So: YABU - Buck up kids, stop being Wet Hens and just read about life’s depressing abyss YANBU - There’s enough doom and gloom already in this world. Let’s read some cheerful, yet literary books while we’re at school"
"AIBU not to buy 8 month old Xmas presents","It will be my baby's first Christmas and I'm so excited for things like the lovely family time and seeing his reaction to the Christmas tree. But ... I'm completely stuck on what to get him! He's sort of between stages, where he has all the walker/bouncers etc, but isn't ready for the next phase. Money is also obviously tight with mat leave. Part of me thinks that with our big extended family he'll be totally overwhelmed by new things, but will I regret not getting him anything 'big' for his first Christmas?? I have got him a few very little bits (maybe<£30). What did others do? He's honestly chuffed with a bit of foil to play with 🤣."
"Working through infidelity? Possible or not?","Dh has been caught online cheating. Pics and messages. The person is known to me but lives on the other side of the world and there is not much chance of anything else between them. He says nothing else has happened or with anyone else and I think I believe him. We have been together for over 20 years and have teenage dc. Now we are at the point of what do I do here. Throw in the towel or try to work it through. Has anyone managed to work through this and if so what needed to happen for trust to be restored? There is other behaviour I haven’t been that happy with too so I’m not sure at this point if I just want to LTB. He said he wants to work through it but then he said ‘you will never be able to trust me again’. So maybe I should just listen to what he is telling me there instead of investing in expensive counselling?"
"Pregnant and DH doesn’t want to make any plans for when the baby is here","I know, I probably should have known better but here’s my dilemma…. Whenever I tried to discuss arrangements for a baby prior to TTC, my DH got mildly upset/irritated and said that I’m not even pregnant yet, so why should we have to discuss childcare / mat leave / finances etc, and - in his words - worry about something that might never be relevant (I wouldn’t call it ‘worrying’, I call it planning). I obviously told him that I would like to have some security and know that I will be able to continue working at some point, and have money available while on mat leave. He then said that I know what kind of man he is and that he’d always support me in everything I want to do, so why should this change when we have the baby. He’s right about this, he’s doing more than his fair share at home and would go out of his way to make sure I have everything I want. So I reluctantly agreed and put the topic to bed. We’re in our 40s so he’s right that a baby was only a vague possibility. Well, now I am 6 weeks pregnant and I have approached the topic of sharing our thoughts about childcare again. He got irritated again and said that the baby isn’t here yet, so why do we need to worry about childcare. He wants to wait until baby is born and then work it out. Obviously I pointed out to him that this is not an option, that I’d have to let my work know when I’m 25 weeks for how long I want to be on maternity leave, and in case he doesn’t want to take time off, we’d need to book a nursery or childcare before baby is born (London - long waiting lists) for when I want to go back to work. It ended in a fight, he’s upset and blames me for opening up problems when we should enjoy the pregnancy. He also said - hopefully in anger - that because I work from home, we won’t need childcare anyway and I don’t need to worry about my maternity leave pay (I have none, different story), I can take two weeks holiday after the birth and then continue working while looking after the baby. I see that this is bad. I’ve learned my lesson. I’m sure that most posts will be LTB, but I’m rather newly married and pregnant. If, God forbid, I lose this pregnancy, I would not try to have a child with him again, and after tonight’s conversation and his unwillingness to hear me out, and being absolutely unreasonable and immature in his views on what it means to look after a baby I’m seriously reconsidering the relationship. But because things are as they are, is there any way to salvage this? Was anyone in a similar situation and it did work out in the end? Although far from ideal, should I just make plans for whatever childcare arrangement suits me and leave him out of it, since he absolutely refuses to plan ahead? Just to add, he wanted this child more than I did, and he generally doesn’t make plans for the future. He lives from one day to the next, I’m the one in our relationship who makes the plans, but he usually goes along with whatever I decide. I have my own savings and a well enough paid job, I could just about manage without his financial contribution."
"DH and the breast milk saga","DD2 is 10 weeks old and EBF. Yesterday I left DH with her and DD1 who is two, for and hour whilst I popped out. DD2 had not long been fed but I left DH with a frozen pouch of breast milk just in case, and two deconstructed sterilised bottles in the steriliser. After 25 mins I got a call to ask whether the condensation in the sterilised bottles had chemicals in that needed rinsing out before pouring the defrosted milk in and I explained that no, you don’t rinse sterilised bottles and you also touch as little as possible- certainly not the teat. (Remember, we covered this in NCT class with DD1’, ‘Yeh yeh yeh, ok.’) DD1 disliked the bottle so DH didn’t get much practice first time around but not for lack of trying- at least 20 or 30 occasions of him having to prepare the bottle of breast milk from frozen whilst I popped out. When I got back, DD2 was asleep but the bottle was still full, on the side and DH explained that she’d fallen back asleep before he’d had a chance to offer it to her anyway. Ok, not a problem. But, he said, DD1 had touched the teat, so it wasn’t sterile any longer. I looked over and saw there was no lid on the bottle, he’d just left it out in the open. He said he didn’t use lids. I explained that you have to use the lid to keep it sterile and obviously curious DD1 would touch it otherwise if she saw it on the table. ‘Yeh yeh yeh, ok’. So we go together to the steriliser and I walk him through putting the other bottle together, transferring the milk, not touching the teat and putting on the lid. Fine. In the meantime DD2 wakes up so he had a chance to try again, which he did. He promptly poured a full 80ml bottle all over himself and her because he hadn’t actually fully tightened the lid. Disaster, much swearing. Then he says ‘wow it’s hot’. Didn’t you test the temp rather on your wrist?’ ‘Huh? No.’ !!!!!! Luckily not scalding but I was pretty annoyed by this point. Full outfit chance for both required, with him asking ‘where do we keep her clothes?’ (Erm, where we have kept them for the last ten weeks, right by the changing mat, which we use about ten times a day?!) I calm down, go into the kitchen to clear up the absolute disaster zone that has developed in the whole hour I’ve been out of the house. I pick up the empty milk pouch to throw it in the bin (just discarded on the side). It hasn’t been cut. He’s just reopened the seal and poured the milk out over the unsterilised opening, straight into the bottle. Thankfully none of the milk ended up being drunk in the end, but I can count 5 unacceptable ‘no no’s here. YANBU= Weaponised incompetence at its finest YABU= Mea culpa, I should have delivered a full detailed walk through and left an instructional video before I attempted to leave the house (PS, no I won’t be LTB, so please save your breath)"
"Am I being unreasonable?","Nc for this one. So Dh is usually very good, very hands on and very respectful. He's a bit more sweary than I am but I have no problem with this provided he's swearing in general and not at me if that makes sense. We previously had a conversation about this and I was very clear with him that swearing at me especially in front of our ds is a huge line for me and he agreed and acknowledged why this was important. I never ever swear at him and am generally very measured even when annoyed. Dh has wrecked his back and is in a lot of pain at the minute. I've suggested physio and painkillers and he's declined both which is up to him, I'm refusing to nag about it. Yesterday we were meant to be going out for the day and I was aware he was still sore and maybe didn't want to go out. So I asked him what he wanted to do today. He said he didn't know he'd see how he feels in a bit. So a bit later I asked again. He then snapped at me and told me to stop f-ing asking when he said he didn't know. Our baby was in the room at the time. I told him not to speak to me like that and I'm just trying to work out what I will do with my day if he would prefer to stay at home and rest. He huffed out of the room and came back in a few minutes later and apologised and accepted he was out of order and I accepted that. Then this morning his alarm went off for work at 6am. Its his day off. It woke me and I ignored it. Then it went off again 30 minutes later, at which point ds who is still in our room starts to stir so i said ""have you somewhere you need to be?"" Granted I was sarcastic but he'd stayed up later until after 2 watching TV and then woken both me and baby coming into bed. Since i ebf if baby wakes up its my job to feed and resettle while dh gets to go straight back to sleep so I was tired and grumpy. It's worth noting this happens most mornings and pisses me off no end because sometimes I can't get baby back over so then I'm up for the day from 6 whereas normally ds would sleep until 7 or 8. He turned round angrily and told me to 'f- up tired, just f- up"" and then rolled back over and went back to sleep. I was so annoyed I couldn't get back over so that was me up for the day. I spoke to him at lunchtime about it (not avoiding him just was busy with the baby and was waiting until things were cooler) and he feels he was not BU and it was my fault for being sarcastic in the first place and won't apologise until I do. I feel that I was not BU and he should be the one to apologise. This is out of character for him and I know it's because he's in pain with his back, but I'm taking over all household duties and looking after the baby while he's resting and I don't feel I should be his verbal outlet when he is in a bad mood. I have never and would never speak to him like that so I don't feel that I'm asking for anything that I don't give myself. Was I BU? This isn't a LTB situation as he is generally great but I'm not sure how we move forward if we're at an impasse because I feel like I need the apology from him."
"To ask the police why they are on my road?","I’m single and live alone on the ground floor. I live in a very, very quiet area (rural countryside, my village has <500 people in it). Crime rate is very low and I feel safe here. Rarely see or hear of any trouble. Tonight there is a police car parked right outside my house, behind a civilian car it seems. The lights are flashing on the police car. It’s dark and not street lit so I can’t see much of what’s going on, and my Ring doorbell is out of range to pick up on what they’re saying. Because I’m alone and on the ground floor it’s really freaking me out. It’s been going on for about 40 minutes. Would I BU to contact the non emergency police number and ask what’s going on? I wouldn’t ask for details but even just to know what type of crime they’re here for would maybe (or maybe not) put my mind at ease. I’ve got a busy day at work tomorrow and it’s really stressing me out 😔"
"AIBU about this London birthday gig present situation?","Compared to other threads, this is all very first-world problems but I feel like I've lost all perspective on this so please let me know if IABU. I found out a few days ago that my favourite band is playing a one-off gig in London this month - the day after my birthday. They were on hiatus for many years, but they played a small comeback gig in Scotland (where I live) earlier this year, and which my DP and I attended and loved. For info, I've been to almost every gig they've ever played in my city, always with DP, and I've loved them for decades. So when I learned they were playing the day after my birthday, I thought it was a total no-brainer as a birthday present. Nothing else would have lived up to it. Especially as we actually travelled several years ago to Ireland for my birthday, where and when the band played a gig. I thought we could make a mini-break out of it in London, like we'd done in Ireland. Easy. But my DP is Not Keen at all. He says there's no point, that we've already seen the band this year. They're releasing a new album soon, so in all likelihood will be touring next year with a good chance of being in our city again. He says there'll be too much rushing around for trains, that the venue is in an awkward place to get out of time-wise, if the gig ends at 11pm and our train is at 11.45pm. It'll be expensive if we also stay overnight, there'll be too much walking around in the cold to kill time, and taking time off work might be an issue. Frankly, he's been a workaholic all year - not really his fault, he's been placed on a big project at work - but we haven't been on holiday, and did nothing for a milestone anniversary. I thought this plan could rectify all of these things by giving us a mini-holiday. I've never seen London at Christmas. So I said, well, if we're staying overnight, we'll do something special the next day that you want to do. Every time we've gone down to London before, because it's such a trek, we usually see two shows/attractions, one for each of us. So he took a look online but said nothing appeals. I just don't think he enjoys London. He says he only went to the Ireland gig because he'd never been to Ireland before. He said he'd have been more likely to go to this gig if the band had announced a one-off gig in Berlin or somewhere we've never been. By now, I'm very exasperated. This is my favourite band, this is my ideal present, nothing else would compare frankly. So I say fine, I'll go down by myself. This alarms DP. He says that if I went down on my own for my birthday, then he would feel incredibly guilty and he should be there with me to celebrate. I shrug and tell him that sounds more like his problem. He's now very sad and having a bit of an existential crisis over it, says it's all he's been thinking about. I don't think he'd forgive himself if I went down alone, but also... I just want to see the band?? And if we both went down, I have a feeling he'd be so stressed about travel that he wouldn't make it the most enjoyable experience. So now we're at a sort of stalemate. DP and I very rarely disagree on things and usually manage to hash something out. I don't know if I'm doing the equivalent of screaming I WANT A PONY and should get over myself, especially as DP only had a modest cinema/restaurant birthday this year, or if I should just LTB, etc. Maybe the tickets will sell out first and we won't have to make a decision??"
"Are emojis only for old people?","I was babysitting my niece yesterday and we got onto a discussion about mobile phones etc. She then said her and her friends only really use symbols when texting. Things like: :) <3 These I remember doing years and years ago, before emojis came along. I asked her about emojis and she said no one really uses them anymore, that she only really likes the heart ones and never a laughing face, only the crying with laughter face. I felt pretty old after that conversation, I’d it just me and I didn’t notice?"
"I need to end it, but I don't want to","I've been in a situationship with a lovely man for the past 3-4 months. We started out casual and were both dating other people, but recently we both stopped seeing anyone else - not because we decided to be exclusive, but just because it worked out that way. We are still casual. The problem is that I've caught feelings. He is gorgeous, funny, very kind. I trust him and feel safe with him. He's considerate, likes to talk and communicate. We have absolutely mindblowing sex - like, beyond amazing. So I suppose it's no surprise that I've started to feel like I want more from him. But I know that I don't really want more. He's younger than me and we are at different stages in our lives. He wants a wife and kids. I'm menopausal. That's not the only difference between us, but it's the main one. There are also things I don't like about him. He spent two hours one evening monologuing at me about his hobby (I nearly died of boredom) and he can be pedantic at times. He usually has to be right (although he never gaslights or speaks unkindly. He just thinks he's right about basically everything.) So he definitely has faults that annoy me. Also we live about two hours away from one another and I don't want an LTR. I know he likes and cares about me, but I think if he said he wanted a relationship with me (he doesn't), I'd probably say no. But for whatever reason, I feel so much for him and it's getting to the point now that I feel so sad when I know I won't see him for a while, and I get upset if he doesn't text for a day or so, even though I will often take a couple of days to message him. I feel like I have to end things because I'm undoubtedly going to get very hurt and there is literally no future for us, unless I'm happy to carry on in this way until it fizzles out. I would miss the sex, which is honestly the best I've ever had, and I doubt it will ever be this good with anyone again. And I would miss his tenderness and his funny, unique way of looking at the world. Someone talk some sense into me, please! How do I walk away when it's so good between us? Edited"
"To wonder how Vernon Kay got away with it?","""In 2010, Kay was forced to apologise to his wife after it was revealed in the British press that he had been sending sexually explicit text and social media messages to model Rhian Sugden every day for four months. Later on, he admitted to sending similar messages to ""four or five"" other women at the same time."" (From Wikipedia). I was just wondering about it as I have him on the radio working at home today. We would all have been telling Tess to LTB on here. I actually don't think he did anything physical with any of them, but I wouldn't have stayed with him."
"Emergency advice needed, relative's life depends on it","I'm sorry to be posting here but I'm in such desperate need of advice that I need the traffic. I'm also sorry it's long. My grandmother has had a government funded place in a care home for the last four years. She is kept there under a DOLs following having been sectioned for self-neglect as a result of a combination of severe mental health issues triggered by Alzheimer's (and now, four years later, the Alzheimer's has started to progress). She has never had an estate or assets to pay for care and we as a family don't possess the means either. Her behaviour over the four years has admittedly been challenging at times (rudeness, biting, etc) but DGM is <5' and genuinely not a physically intimidating person, even if she can be difficult. However her behaviour as she's deteriorated both physically and mentally, so over the last 18 or so months, has improved and she is mostly co-operative with the care home staff nowadays with some encouragement. As far as we have been made aware, her care needs up until the last couple of months were mostly showering and encouragement to keep sanitary. She has only very recently required assistance with changing her own pads (we don't know if she doesn't recognise or doesn't care when she sitting in mess). She was fully mobile and didn't require any special diets. A few weeks ago we were alerted that she hadn't appeared herself and hadn't eaten, however we weren't told until end of play on the third day that this was occurring. We said we wanted her to see the GP the following day as a matter of urgency, and the GP prescribed antibiotics for a UTI. The home were calling my DM on a daily basis saying DGM was refusing to take her tablets or drink, as well as still refusing to eat. DM was going over daily and getting her to drink at least a cup of water and take her tablets without much difficulty, just a lot of prompting. The staff said they didn't have time to sit and prompt her to drink. On the fourth day they called my DM and said DGM suddenly couldn't swallow fluids and that they'd called 999 because they were concerned she might choke. My DM took emergency leave and raced over there, to find no issues with her swallowing, no signs of a stroke, etc. DM had told the home she was prepared to take DGM to A&E herself due to the ambulance wait times, and so before DM even got there, the home had cancelled the ambulance. DM called me while she was there as my partner is a paramedic, and the staff outrightly refused to speak to him saying they didn't care what he had to say and wanted her to go to A&E. There was also a doctor from the surgery at the home when the swallowing difficulty occurred and the home reported that the GP refused to see DGM because ""she'd be assessed at hospital"". DM ended up taking her. On assessment at A&E, they found urine burns so severe that they immediately safeguarded the home and made an in patient referral to one of the dermatology teams. They said they'd never seen damage like it. She has since been kept in hospital on IV antibiotics for the UTI. They have also had SALT in who have advised DGM appears to be having difficulty swallowing food which is why she hasn't always been eating and now requires a softer diet. A few days ago they declared her fit for discharge, however the home said they wanted to make an assessment first. DM asked what they meant and they said they needed to see whether she required a hospital bed and whatnot first, fine. However last night they called DM to say they refuse to have her back on the basis she now needs nursing care, and that was that. Having to stay in hospital for a prolonged period of time whilst another care facility is found, and then the upheaval of moving to a new home/unfamiliar environment is legitimately going to kill DGM. I know what you're probably thinking, ""why would you want her to go back to somewhere that let her get to that state?"" and whilst I do completely agree that their care was, at least on this occasion, awful, I am also aware of how difficult a change in routine is for DGM's mental state. The hospital were going to discharge her with District Nurse support as well as regular SALT input/review and OT. We are in shock that the home can refuse to have someone back when no alternative plan is in place, and thus she can be left in hospital unnecessarily. We believe the safeguarding made against them and the complaint my DM has made about the whole situation has basically made them not want her back now. We genuinely don't even know where to start with getting help now. We don't know who to call to find her somewhere else because she is public funded, we don't know if there's anyone we can call who is able to force them to take her back temporarily with additional external support in place, we don't know if we should be phoning someone like the CQC or a solicitor or something as the impression we've been given my the hospital is her UTI likely stemmed from the same circumstances that lead to huge skin damage from urine burns. Please help with any experience/signposting."
"LL wanting to put rent up - Twat!","This is the 5th house ive lived in with a shit back door. They are aaaaaall unusual sizes, of course! I swear LL's must think we're fucking stupid, maybe we are! Its the faux surprise... YOU FUCKING KNOW THE DOOR IS SHIT....why are you just now, 30 odd years after owning the house realizing it might need fucking replacing. Don't get me started on the 80% of the double glazing that has blown - most with broken latches, the hall way full of black mold, the stair carpet that was fitted by monkies, the frayed carpet at EVERY door way, no extractor in the bathroom - more black mold. The stain on the kitchen ceiling from a leak (not our fault) 2 years ago Outside tap broken, inside tap dripping 2 ltrs a day, over flowing guttering and the back fence has just blown down. Also the fact we offered more rent each month at the beginning of our tenancy as we were desperate to secure the property, and we are STILL waiting for our new TA since the renting regulations changed in Wales last year. Txt this morning to say he was putting rent up by £50 from next month. I know I'm not unreasonable, hes a twat and I just needed to rant. I've rented all my life, will never own, late 40's and two teens and I'm just sick of being treated like shite by moneygrabbing bastards! I"
"Stay or go?","In my early 50s - partner is 6 years older. We met on OLD and have been together for 5 months. He is great company, we laugh a lot together, fancy each other and have a good, active sex life. We are compatible in terms of career, interests, finances - both of us are fit and healthy, have good circle of friends, grown up children (some still at home but v independent and plan to move out in next couple of years). Most importantly I believe he is honest and genuine. My last two LTRs ended badly when I found out that they were fundamentally dishonest/unfaithful so this is an incredibly attractive trait for me. My problem is that he is very closed down emotionally. He has told me that he likes me a lot, but that’s as far as it goes. He struggles to be affectionate outside of the bedroom and I feel that we are almost FWB (although we are exclusive). I am yearning for more intimacy and am starting to feel quite sad and low. We have talked about this and he has reassured me that he has ‘strong feelings’ for me but that it takes him a long time to open up and he wants to let the relationship continue and develop. I’m left feeling like I have to jump through some invisible hoop - I’m not sure what else he wants or needs from me - we both know each other pretty well by now. On one hand, I respect his need to take things at his own pace and not feel pressured or rushed into any sort of commitment - obviously at our age we both have histories/baggage. On the other hand, I am not expecting to move in together or get married, but just need to feel cared for and loved. I feel quite tearful writing this as it’s obviously a deep need and I don’t think it’s excessive or unreasonable. Most of my friends think I should cut my losses and move on. However, I know that he is a decent guy and that there aren’t actually that many of them out there - I do really like him but can’t bear feeling like this. Any advice / experiences appreciated. At present I’m thinking that I’ll give it till Christmas but today I’m having a bad day and not sure I can last that long."
"DH’s crisis of masculinity","Trying to get a better understanding of my DH’s outlook. I really don’t want any brash LTB comments because our relationship is generally good. We’ve been together 10 years and I’ve always been the higher earner. Sometimes much higher sometimes only slightly. My job has more career progression and I have worked hard to climb up. DH is more limited, it’s construction sector and depends on seasons, he dips in and out of sole trader and contracted worker so it varies. It is something he has only brought up over the past couple of years that he can feel emasculated that I earn more. That he is the man and he should be the main provider for the family. In a conversation over dinner tonight he’s stated that men aren’t happy unless they are providing for a family. I said he does provide for his family and works very hard and the fact my job happens to pay more is no reflection on him. Would he be happier to have a housewife and us have less money coming in and less of a comfortable life? No he said. so I don’t know what the issue is or where this comes from. I used to think he was proud of me, he used to like telling people what I do and that I’m good at my job. Similarly I am proud of him and tell people so. He used to be my biggest cheerleader but now he seems to see my career has some insult to his ‘masculinity’. He also sees himself as the ‘protector’ of the household. And has bared grudges against my DD17 having a boyfriend in the house like it’s some sort of threat. And when our car was vandalised in the street a little while back (and we knew who it was) he felt his role as ‘protector’ was undermined as I insisted we dealt with it through the right channels rather than the ways he wanted to which were illegal. I have one DD who lives with us and he has 50/50 care of his 2 DDs. There are a lot of women around, is that it? Is there not enough testosterone in our house? He’s great with the girls he does all manner activities from letting them paint his nails and make perfumes to teaching them to fish and play football. He’s really strong on education for them and doing well at school and have careers so I just don’t know where it comes from. to be honest I find it hard not to find it all a bit pathetic but I love this man very much and so I try where I can to respect how he feels. But I can’t see a solution to it or how things could be different. I have considered whether he is having some sort of mental health crisis. Another factor is that he does now work with very, what I would call, ‘blokey blokes’ and the whether that’s an influence. it makes me sad that he seems to take issue with something I am proud of. I was a very young Mum and a single mum for a long time and I worked hard to be independent and provide for me and my DD. It was at times very tough and its a big part of who I am, he knows that. I used to think it was one of the things he loved about me 😞 Sorry that’s long, but I don’t have many people I could let that out to in IRL and would be interested in thoughts or others experiences"
"Husband says he's 'very unsatisfied' with sex life","He says I don't make an effort. He feels like he has to persuade me for sex. And example... I asked him for a massage then we can have sex and used a timer purely because otherwise he will massage for 30 seconds then say he wants to have sex and I need warming up more. He says our sex life very vanilla and feels functional as opposed to sexual and he feels like my housemate instead of DH. Please don't want to hear LTB this is a genuine issue and I'd rather try and fix than walk away from my marriage. Any suggestion please or been through similar anyone?"
"Is the bar set too high if you're single?","I read so many posts on MN telling women to set their bar higher. I often wonder if these posters who cry LTB are single or not. I have friends in my life telling me i should ditch my current man, as my bar is apparently too low. Editted to add that they think the bar is too low as he can ditch me last minute occasionally; neither he nor his ex wife can be arsed to complete their divorce paperwork 5 years on; he can be a bit grumpy at times; he can put a negative spin on things sometimes where there isn't one; he doesn't really initiate us seeing each other, it's mostly me doing that. These friends have been married 10yrs+. I listen to their whinges and whines about their husbands but apparently that doesn't mean their bar is too low. I've had a 20yr marriage which ended because he cheated. The 3 significant relationships I've had since, my bar is/was too low on 2 of them according to MN/friends. The 3rd was too effusive in his affections and needed too much TLC, so I ended it. I'm sticking with the current guy, as I like having someone to do things with. I like messaging through the day with him. I tolerate the annoyances, because he's a good companion. I prefer being with him to being single. I enjoy holidaying, going to the theatre, eating out by myself. But I enjoy them more with company. My very few single friends rarely want to join me. My multiple married friends always have plans at weekends. The things I do with the current guy, my friends wouldn't be up for joining me at. And I love sex. A vibe is just not the same. So, I choose to stick with my apparently low bar man until this magical man, aged 40-55, who meets all the high criteria society say I should look for comes along. YABU- Respect yourself sister and stay single until that great man appears YANBU - It's better to have a low bar partner to do things with than be single. Stop listening to the people in couples/single woman with little interest in living a full on social life Edited"
"DH obsessed with ex and now I am attracted to her, AIBU?","So DH and I started as a holiday romance, well, he was a glam widower on holiday and I was working. Hot sunny Euro locale, instant attraction. My friends warned me with words like 'He's a Tory voter' 'He has a country place FFS' 'What about the age gap,' but honestly, girls can be jealous. Anyway we got married and returned from honeymoon to his swanky house 'Mumblesey' by the sea in the south west. Servants and the whole shebang. I was a little intimidated but determined to make a go of things. Only to find out he is obsessed with his ex, 'Becks'. Everything is the way she left it, her writing paper, her raincoats with her handkerchiefs in the pocket, her bloody bedroom set up for her and some crazy twat of a housekeeper who brought Becks up and also seems obsessed. DH goes all cold and grim and sinister when Becks is mentioned. And then I found out. I was led to believe Becks was DEAD and from DH's reactions I was beginning to think he'd murdered her! Then one evening walking by the shore I went into this old boathouse... and there she was. Smoky eyes, lithe figure, one hand in her pocket and the other one holding a cigarette. I was instantly attracted. She began to rant about how DH was so conventional and strait-laced and homophobic and a priggish boring wanker who only cared about his posh house and reputation, and she'd had to leave and move into the boathouse. She was obviously bisexual and, well, she stirred me to my depths. I haven't acted on this yet but the more time I spend in the boathouse the more I am attracted to her and not to DH. Thoughts? YABU: You can't shag your husband's ex, however smoky her eyes are. Shame on you. YANBU: Shag away, my darling, let yourself be thrilled to your very depths, and BTW, LTB."

"I have a fever and DH has gone out on a jolly after riling up the kids","He's been away for almost 3 weeks with work (and been able to tag on visiting friends in the locale at the same time), he's come back, and now is straight out on a jolly. Kids are 3yo and 7m. When he got back from his trip he left a massive pile of washing outside our laundry cupboard. I ignored it. He moved it inside the laundry cupboard. I ignored it. Even my 3yo knows to put their clothes in the laundry basket at the end of the day. He asked why I hadn't done his washing. I told him because the washing basket was empty. Arse. I'm so tired and run down I can't even think straight and left my bag on the bus earlier. I'm running a fever and ache to the core. He riled up the 3yo and made all sorts of promises about outings that I would take them on today (whilst ill, in the sodding rain). Then he went on his jolly. Did I mention I am unwell? He's in the spare room tonight. No help with baby night wakings is better than expecting help with baby night wakings and receiving none. I know there is a lot of underlying resentment. I'm not going to drip feed the rest of my 'he's a knob' woes. There's too many! I probably should LTB. Just need to vent. Send hot chocolate and hot water bottles. Edited"
"Feel guilty I can't treat DP","First time poster so go easy please! This might sound like a daft problem and I probably just need telling to sort myself out (!) but bear with me... I have been with DP for 18 months and everything has been great. We own our own homes but see each other most nights after work and weekends. I get on brilliantly with his daughter, we're on the same page when it comes to sex, finances, work ethics, morals, family values etc. Everything just feels so easy with him. The ONLY thing which plays on my mind is that, from what I know about his exes (one marriage and 2 LTR), he has only been with women who are either really wealthy (come from money) or have extremely well paid jobs so he has been used to living the high life. Just for clarity, he doesn't really talk about any of this but I knew him through work for a long time before we were a couple so I am aware of the life he's led, nice holidays, cars etc. I'm not sure how he ended up with these women btw as he's just a regular bloke and certainly not materialistic or money orientated! By comparison I have a 2 bed terrace and work in a regular, ok-ish paid job. We both earn similar amounts of money (he used to earn a lot more but took a pay cut to get a better work / life balance). He helps me out a bit financially as we tends to stay at mine more than at his. He tells me - and I know - that he is happier with me and more content than he ever has been in his life and never, ever compares or even talks about his previous relationships. If I ever I mention feeling bad about not being able to buy him something he tells me I'm being ridiculous and he wouldn't trade what he has now for anything. I know he's telling the truth but - I think it comes from growing up without money - I can't help feeling inferior to his exes and wanting to be able to buy him the things he has been used to before?! I know I need to chill out and just be grateful for what I have and stop torturing myself! But how do I stop the comparisons?!"
"I just resolved yesterday to stop spending money like water...","I'm a fairly comfortably off recent widow (my own job, nothing to do with being widowed, that all went to DC) who has spent the last couple of years building a new life. ""Company"" when you're single costs money in a way that it doesn't when you're part of an established couple. E.g you go out for coffee /drinks/food/cinema rather than vegging on the sofa together. Also I've developed new hobbies that cost money and taken on some personal challenges, I'm just back from a week's adventure on my own. Anyway, I resolved on my way home that I really must have a few months of not spending so much. Not becuase I can't afford it but because with inflation etc and never knowing what's round the corner. Then I met some friends for breakfast (already failing at the first hurdle) whosr pretty much opening remark was ""are you coming to <event in interesting European city I've never been to> with us?"" I'm rubbish at this 😆"

She vomited again overnight also Aibu to want to stay?

"Help! Confused, so many arguments","Help! I don't know what's real or not any more. I'm in a relationship with my partner, we've been together about 4 years, but have been struggling in the last couple of years. I really wanted to make it work, but we keep arguing. Over nothing. Over silly things. He always makes out I'm the problem, too stressed, that I've started it, either through picking an argument or not responding in the right way to something he's said. Either way it feels like it's always my fault. In the last year or so he keeps having this series of big dramatic moments where he'll storm out of the room calling me names and then sulks upstairs. When I've gone up to try and resolve things (trying to be the mature one and the peacemaker, and to see his side) he's generally vile and everything gets thrown back in my face and he attacks me verbally and makes me feel like absolutely crap. Sometimes I've taken it, because I've reflected and thought perhaps I have been the difficult one, but the arguments/conversations have nearly broken me at times. I had some PTSD and emotional/trust issues after getting out of an abusive relationship a few years ago, and then I was in a difficult/stressful job which made me wonder if my behaviour and mood had been challenging for him to deal with and I was the cause of the problems... maybe I am? We had another argument today. I had a really tough day in a new job and just wanted to talk/have some support at the end of the day, but it was really hard to engage him and I felt he wasn't listening. And so we fell out, he stormed off etc etc. Spoke to him and he said he's been deliberately spending less and less time with me, that he's always on edge around me, always biting his tongue. That I'm like a bomb waiting to go off. That he'd taken more than he can take at Christmas. He basically presented himself as this loving boyfriend/victim who has been so supportive but endured so much from me. I tried to defend myself and argue against some of these things which I felt weren't true, but in the end I had to leave the room as I just felt so hurt by what he was saying, and felt generally unlovable Anyway, he keeps doing this every few weeks/months.....I don't understand....if I'm that awful why not just leave? It hadn't occured to me before, but today I thought is this some deliberate tactics to keep me on my toes and knock my confidence, so I feel like he may leave at any time, and to give him the upper hand? Or am I just really difficult and volatile like he makes out? I'm so confused and my head is spinning. Any thoughts/advice is welcome. I'm too emotionally involved to see things clearly. I read my post back and realise it really doesn't sound great and that there might be quite a bit of LTB. Perhaps I should, unless it's me being the issue and he's just at his wits end with me? Please help."

"To think this should have more media coverage and political support?","How many women are bringing up their children without any financial input from the other parent? How many women are fighting the CMS system because their child’s father is self employed/Ltd Company Director/job hopping. How many absent fathers are asked in news reports, “where are you with regards to financial support for your child? Yet, regardless they will retain all parental legal rights to their child. If over 90% of resident parents (mothers) opted out of financial support for their children, the children would be in care, and the mothers would be in jail. Is it time that fathers who very clearly, and wilfully, and criminally avoid financially supporting their children should face much tougher penalties. Surely that brings some sort of equality to parenting? Bad news – but Gingerbread will fight on! POSTED 15 DECEMBER 2023 Today, the court has ruled in the case on the Child Maintenance Service (CMS) that we have been involved with. We’re sorry to say it’s not good news. The case was brought by a group of single parents and the children of single parents. Together they argued that problems with the CMS are causing them “significant and prolonged financial difficulties”. They argued that the way the CMS operates, including the insufficient enforcement of payment obligations against non-resident parents, was discriminatory and unlawful. They also argued that the Government needed to better support victim-survivors of domestic abuse in running the CMS. We had hoped to see significant reform of the CMS as a result of the case. But we’re incredibly disappointed that today, the judge ruled in favour of the Government and agreed with them that the way the system is being operated is lawful. Gingerbread got involved with the case to share our expertise and knowledge. We hear day in, day out from single parents who tell us that they are owed thousands of pounds from their child’s other parent. All too often they tell us that the CMS is failing to put enforcement action in place. And what’s worse, we hear from single parents who say the system is allowing their ex-partner to perpetuate economic abuse. We also know that: 140,000 children are not receiving a penny of the maintenance they are legally entitled to since 2012, when the CMS began, £590.6 million in unpaid maintenance has accumulated if child maintenance were paid in full to all children in separated families living in poverty who currently do not receive financial support from their other parent, it would have the potential to lift 60% of them out of poverty. We believe that there’s something seriously wrong with a Child Maintenance Service that leaves so many children without the support they deserve. It’s clear that we have an uphill struggle to change the system. Right now, we’re looking ahead to the next election. . We’ve been talking to all political parties about the need to reform the CMS. But we know that there are other issues which matter to single parents too. We’re running a survey on what our priorities should be . We’re asking single parents to tell us what matters to them, so we can make sure your voice is heard! We’re also about to start a new project researching the challenges of the CMS and developing with single parents clear recommendations for reform. This will help us make the case for change with any new Government. More information will be available on this in the new year."
"To be SO frustrated by threads like this…","First of all I want to make it crystal clear that I am not frustrated with the OPs of these threads, I am frustrated for them. I don’t blame them one bit. There seems to be a steady stream of threads that go something like this: OP: Asks if she is being unreasonable then describes the situation whereby it is indisputable that it’s in fact her DH / DP who is being unreasonable. PPs: With their spidey senses tingling as they detect potential gaslighting / narcissism / manipulation / abuse / coercive control / fuckwittery, ask OP for more details and also ask what the DH is usually like, and reassure OP unanimously that she is not being unreasonable. OP: Gives more background info and history that confirms that PPs were correct, there is a pattern of abuse / fuckwittery and/or a whole childhood full of neglect / abuse - meaning that OP is completely brainwashed and browbeaten and believes that this behaviour is normal and she cannot trust her gut and has to put up with it (and so do her kids). PPs: Rally round OP, explaining (again, unanimously) that OP does not need to endure the abuse / mistreatment / misery for one day longer and would be completely justified in LTB no matter what he says. Suggest if she cannot find the strength to leave for herself, them do it for her children who deserve to live happily and have good role models - advice to break generational cycles. OP: Is terrified at the idea, due to having zero self esteem, no support, or having been gaslit and manipulated to within an inch of her life into believing she needs DH to survive and won’t find anyone else, can’t afford to leave etc and is convinced she and her kids are trapped. PPs: give reassurance that OP can LTB. Give OP details of practical, real life support agencies, websites, Women’s Aid, Freedom Programme, books, scripts for what to say to police / DH, advice on legal aid for solicitors, getting ducks in a row, securing important documents, confide in real life friends or family etc etc OP: Starts backtracking and offering examples of how her DH is not that bad / is a good dad / might be depressed or ND / can be really nice to her sometimes / always apologises etc. PPs: Continue to reassure OP that her relationship is toxic / abusive and damaging her and her kids and there are ways to leave and support out there. OP: Never returns to the thread, perhaps deciding that their bar is lower than they realised and they are doomed to this life. Very occasionally, the OP will return to confirm that they have found the strength to leave, have taken PPs’ advice, called Woman’s Aid or a solicitor, and have ended the relationship. These threads are so satisfying, PPs rejoice that OP has taken their advice and changed her life for the better, one less abused woman! One more single shitty man. Amazing. But they are the minority. What are we doing when girls are raised to be compliant, nice, submissive, people pleasing ghosts? How do we raise girls to be sure of their value, have high standards and expectations, unwavering instincts and the confidence to listen to them, and to refuse to put up with this toxic bullshit from men? How do we raise boys to have integrity, to see girls as human beings, to be non violent, unselfish, compassionate people? I am so frustrated on behalf of all the OPs out there who, despite unanimous, practical and compassionate support on MN, cannot appreciate their value or raise that bar for what they will tolerate from a man? I don’t blame the OPs one bit - I blame their parents, previous partners, and society. It’s utterly heartbreaking. AIBU?"
"Huge, overwhelming fear of having disabled child","Good afternoon Mumsnet I'm very new here, so I hope I've done the right things with the thread/topic. I have been on and off trying for our first baby for a few years now, but having had a big career overhaul in the last year I've put off anything happening for the past 12 months, and went back on the pill, but now I'm settled I'd like to try again. For clarity, I have ADHD and my DH has undiagnosed AuDHD (he exhibits aspects of both, but I'd argue he's heavily skewed ADHD more than Autism) - I am medicated and happy that way, DH is coping with his symptoms so isn't necessarily in a rush for a diagnosis, whereas I was struggling after an incorrect bipolar diagnosis and awful treatment for the past 8 years. I'm 32 and DH is 29. I don't want to wait too long to have a baby and would ideally like to be a mother by the time I'm 34. However, getting to the point of it, I am deathly scared of having a child with severe needs, in particular Autism. I know it's an unreasonable fear, but please hear me out. My best friend has a four year old child who has severe Autism. Her husband is incredibly unhelpful and often wishes that the child would 'get better', has said he would have to put the child up for adoption if my friend left/died etc. He is absent and obsessed with his video games, spends no time with their two children (they have an older child, 10, who has mild ND symptoms). Now, my DH is far more supportive overall than my friend's husband is. I'm well aware that my friend's marriage isn't just affected by their child, but the child is definitely going to be the end of it. However I've seen how hard it is for her, she had to give up her career to care for her child. They are completely non-verbal and highly unlikely to ever speak. I've seen her at her most downtrodden, from her husband's awful behaviour and the difficulties their child presents. I love the child to bits, I would consider myself an aunt, I've been close to them since she was pregnant. The child trusts me and I help out, I understand their routines but sometimes when I'm with them I think 'I could never ever do this, not in a milllion years'. Because they're the only child I have in my life, though, their condition feels like its more common than it probably is, they're the only child in their nursery class like this, but they're all I ever see, and of course my friend hangs out more with other ND child parents. Perhaps this inflates my perception of it? I grew up chasing my career, I finally have my dream job. It's taken me years of struggle, trauma from a previous DV relationship, mental health maltreatment by the NHS and I'm finally at the point where my life is stable, happy, calm, peaceful. I feel ready for a baby, but I am so so scared of ending up like my friend. I see her struggles, I've felt her pain, I've seen the torture she goes through. I know she loves her DC so so much, but I know she feels frustration and sadness, like any ND parent would. I don't think I'm strong enough for it - I know though I could deal with an ADHD child because of both me and my husband being ADHD heavy, I recognise it now and I know I will bring up an ADHD child with awareness and give them the help I never had - I was only diagnosed this year as an adult. Having a child like my friends' though, with the potential of either of us having to give up our hard-earned careers, the high divorce rate, the heavier commitment with severely disabled children, terrifies me beyond reason. I don't know if I'm just being scared of something that's got such a slim chance - my ADHD doctor made me very aware that my chances of a child with ADHD are much higher, especially with DH. I also know that I don't have anything against ASD - when you're ND you tend to flock to similar people, so so many people in my life, including DH, my brother, my best and closest friends have Autism or Autistic traits. I work in a field with a LOT of ND people. Whilst ADHD and Autism have a lot of crossover though, they are still very different, I can get frustrated with Autistic behaviours in some people, which is an initial reaction due to my ADHD and not my true feelings - its just a reaction my brain does initially because it doesn't add up to me and can frustrate me, before I critically think. I find this only with adults though. It's more the aspect of the child being more than mildly disabled, any disability, that scares me, I really don't think I could cope. I don't know how people do. And that leads to so much guilt, because I am torn - should I even want to be a mother if I am scared of the prospect of disability? Surely I should just be grateful no matter what? And am I being ethically right by having a maternal child when I KNOW I will have someone with a high chance of ADHD, is it fair to them that I know it will happen? Knowing how they will struggle? Should I adopt and break the cycle? So sorry for the big rant. I know that this paints me as a horrible person, I'm prepared for the hate. I just can't get it out of my head. I know not every child is perfectly healthy in and out, that's fine. It's more the idea of having a child that will need much more severe needs for the rest of my, and their, life. I have anxiety, as well, if it wasn't super obvious, and this kind of panic can eat someone alive. It makes someone unreasonable. I really ask, if possible, to have any empathetic responses, but please also be honest. Thank you for reading <3"
"Is this marriage salvageable?","This will be long. I think I know the answer, but would appreciate the outside perspective. Married 5 years, together 7. We have 2 DCs, 3 year old and 4 months old. We both work in professional jobs with good incomes, I am now on maternity leave with second DC. My problem is two-fold. One is that DH leads a lifestyle of a child less man, while having 2 planned kids. Yes, I wanted children more than he did, but nobody held a gun to his head when we were making them. Outside of nursery (while I am on mat leave older DC going to nursery two days a week, then it will be full time once I go back for both), I do all of the childcare for both children. He hasn't changed a single nappy since #2 was born, in fact he doesn't pick #2 up when he cries. 'he wants food' <I am breastfeeding> DH's idea of disciplining is through shouting. In fact, every time I leave the room there is a 90% chance he will shout at DS(3) 'to discipline'. DS(3) is your average 3 year old, there is no out of ordinary challenging behaviour. I do all bath times and bedtimes. I don't think he ever read a book to either of them. As a result DS(3) is not bonded to him. The only time DH spent one on one time with DS(3) is when I was in hospital having #2. He also does minimal housework, but is a messy person. I knew he is not exactly the dad of the year when going for #2, but he didn't really shout when we had only one child and he had better mood. This brings me to his personality. For past several months constantly irritable, he is always moaning about something or annoyed at something. Walks through the door and starts complaining. In addition, something always hurts. It's nothing major, a sore finger, or a headache, or a random pulled muscle etc. He is glued to his phone All. Day. Long. While I am running around keeping the house going and sorting out two kids, he is on the sofa on his phone, no matter if it's bedtime, bathtime or apocalypse. More often than not I have to say things twice before he registers I am addressing him. It's really wearing. I find it a lot easier when he is not at home. Needless to say he never did any of the night wakes for any of the children. I am tired. I am really annoyed he shouts at DC(3) and does literally nothing with DS#2. His constant moods are a drag. In turn I just shut down and focus on the kids. I try to be a more affectionate wife, but all of the above makes my undercarriage shut tight. His good qualities are: he is very intelligent, interesting conversation (when he bothers, that it), very loyal, hardworking. So, my question is, do I keep trying to do something about the above or do I call it quits and separate? In case of separation, he would probably push for 50:50 which would break my heart."
"Sunak is an enemy of children - he must go","He now wants to get rid of 20mph speed limits. Maybe when one of his kids gets run over on the way to the park will he give a shit. I despise him. https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/30/rishi-sunak-councils-20mph-speed-limit-low-traffic-neighbourhoods-ltns"
"Struggling to support JK Rowling…","…because what sort of actual monster wants coffee [& walnut] cake for their birthday cake? She even boasted about this [book-themed] bakery beastliness on Twitter . It was surprise!cake, but clearly not in a Cake Roulette sort of surprise!cake way. Am shaken to my very core & clearing my diary for mad angry crying & performative packing-up of Potterphenalia. I’m just not sure how to cope with this disturbance to the magical world. I mean, coffee cake. <shakes head sadly> However, while I consider my position, I’m willing to be gracious & offer JKR birthday wishes as well as Superior Cake. It’s not as if people just have varying tastes & opinions or anything, after all, right? Oh & happy birthday to Harry Potter, too, who obviously doesn’t need to attend the cake reeducation course, because of course he agrees with me. (Little late - courtesy of internet issues - & indeed little/lot silly. Not inspired by any specific individual, but rather the reflection even now, as support for JKR is trending there are people throwing wobblies because she is a real person with thoughts & feelings & opinions she expresses. And she doesn’t respond to demands/threats/tantrums so people make ridiculous claims about what the characters she wrote [would] think…)"
"To say to anyone considering LTB…","… just bloody do it. This is my third Christmas as a single parent and it is sooooooo much nicer / easier / more relaxing than as an (unhappily) married one. I’m sat on the sofa with Prosecco, watching the Sewing Bee Christmas special. Presents are wrapped. Kids are asleep. All is calm and well. I don’t need to worry about what time he’ll be home or how hungover he’ll be in the morning. I’m not feeling resentful about doing it all on my own, because this is what I chose. I’ve bought what I want, without criticism. We’ll eat what we want tomorrow. Honestly, if you’re worrying it’ll be harder on your own, or staying together ‘for the kids’, don’t. Just LTB."
"Not married parent, am I bonkers to be part time?","I am hoping for some advice regarding finances and future planning as an unmarried but partnered mum. Currently, I’m working PT since returning from mat leave last year. My partner and I of 10+ years own a home together but are not married and likely will never be (he doesn’t want to get married, has said he basically wants to protect his own assets. This isn’t a guess. He has said this but I think instantly regretted letting me know it) He’s a lovely man and a great dad but I know I am in a tricky situation financially both short and long term. He is the higher earner and likely will be as his industry prints money. I don’t want to be FT again until my LO is in school, a couple of years away. I know lots of people will say to go FT again immediately (or LTB, having cake and eating cake etc) but I won’t give up this short time with my LO when school is only a few years away and I have many years ahead until I’ll need to pull a pension, if we can afford it. I plan to head up the career ladder and possibly retrain into a higher paying industry to boost my income and essentially (DP has suggested I do this and will support me financially doing it) be able to provide for myself and my child long term. Could I hear any positive stories about this if this is your experience please? Am I being unreasonable to be panicking about this now? I have a long career ahead of me right? to help boost my own savings? I can enjoy these few years with LO without financial worry (all being well…)? Currently DP pays for most things for our household which allows me to save. So does he but think £300 (mine) compared to 3k (his) so we are totally out of balance in that. I know I cannot rely on him aside from this and the marriage thing has been an eye opener of course and that he wants all the benefits of a wife without any of the risk of a wife. He knows about the inheritance tax issue and does not see this as a reason to protect either of us by getting married. I would not want a wedding but would be happy to be legally married - not so much for romance (I do love him very much) but the financial security and avoidance of IT. I now know that no matter what, I need to plan for my child and I to be left high and dry. Day to day this isn’t his character (generous generally but a saver) but clearly, it’s something my DP thinks about and I need to, too. An ultimatum not an option, I’ve no interest in marrying a reluctant husband 😂"
"Am I out of touch with reality?","Basically I can’t work out what’s affordable or maybe I should say acceptable (as in personally acceptable) to pay as a mortgage. Hands up, I’m used to and accustomed to my low rate of 2% meaning my current mortgage is £700 for a 4 bed house. My fix is coming to an end and rates are, well not 2% anymore, so despite being in the 60% LTV bracket payments are, in my eyes, huge. so I’d like to hear from other people, given our circumstances (which I’ll list below) what they think would be an acceptable amount to pay on a mortgage. Atm I’m having moments of panic and then thinking it will all be ok, and I’m just out of touch with how much people pay on rent/ mortgages and was lucky with such a low cost for so long. so both dh and I work. Combined income of 95k (before tax) take home after tax and deductions 5.4k. Childcare costs about £800per month. Protection is part of deductions. Energy is £150 a month. Food about £500. No debts. Car owned outright, petrol £100, Netflix and phones £50 a month. Internet £50, council tax £145. how much would you consider acceptable or ok to pay? What would your ceiling be?"
"For having simmering resentment towards my husband","Looking for experiences from those who’ve been in a similar situation, and how it was resolved. Apologies in advance for the length. I’ll start by saying DH is in most ways a great husband - I’ve no doubt of his love for me, he works hard, helps around the house with DIY (which he’s good at), is intelligent, honest, and makes me laugh every day. We are married 3 years, early 30s, and thinking of starting a family soonish. However, over the last 6 months we have bickered on and off quite badly. I think the last 24 hours is a summary snapshot. DH was away for a week with work. I enjoyed the time to myself, kept the house tidy and got into a good routine with dog walking, work and chores. DH returned yesterday, very nice arrival saying we’d missed each other, very affectionate. Great. We get home, and he opens a load of packages that have arrived for him. I ask him to put the empty boxes under the stairs, a 30 second job. He tells me he’s too busy, and makes a “joke” (often made) that unlike me he has a real job. I’m a solicitor. I end up, a couple of hours later, clearing the boxes away myself. I actually have to point out I’ve done it to get any thanks. Later, he’s huffing and puffing around and tells me he’s tidying. I ask what he means. It transpires he is putting away his own clothes left out before he went away and unpacking his suitcase, which he seems to think deserves some sort of commendation. He’s then generally a bit quiet through the evening, saying he’s exhausted. We have dinner, and I go to bed, leaving him to play video games. This morning, conscious we’ve been communicating badly recently, I raise with him that I’m concerned I cannot find the keys for the safe, which contains most of my jewellery, but don’t want to make it a big deal, just mentioning so he’s aware / can help. He says he’s already told me where to look. I explained I’ve done that looking, and still cannot find them. I was not the last one to use them. He tells me it doesn’t matter, and at worst we’ll just drill the safe (a gift from my family, which would render it useless). He then proceeds to show me various YouTube videos. When he’s done, I tell him I’m going back to my reading, in a tone that conveys I’m not really impressed. He tells me that I hate him. I explain I’ve just tried to raise a topic that matters to me, that I’m concerned about, and his attitude was entirely dismissive. No apology, we just read in silence. Thanks to anyone who’s made it to the end. Not every day is like this, but I would say it is weekly. The good equalities I’ve mentioned at the beginning are also present weekly or daily. So I’m not looking for LTB responses"
"To want him to leave his job :(","NC for this as I am a regular poster and I didn't think I'd be one doing one of these threads. I have been with DP several years, both second relationships and kids between us. We live together and have a happy, solid relationship (or so I thought). Found out a couple of months ago that DP was messaging a woman from work (I know, the cliche), I was looking at something on his phone and messages came through from someone I didn't know. Turns out they have been messaging on and off for several months. I'd say it was an emotional affair, some of the messages had sexual undertone and shared intimate details, he says they never spent any time alone together and it was just messaging, says he didn't realise how inappropriate/unfaithful it had got and although he knew it was secretive and wrong he hadn't seen it as cheating. They are no longer in any contact via Whatsapp which was what it was previously, or any messaging, I have free access to check his phone whenever he wants and he has been very sorry about it. I'm not here for the LTB messages, I've accepted I want to try and make the relationship work and work through this. However, I'm really struggling that him and his colleague still work together and see each other daily. It feels unreasonable to ask him to leave a job he enjoys and has worked in a long time, but equally I do feel if they were to completely cut ties and he didn't see her anymore, it would really help me to move past this. Just after everyone's thoughts. I have not asked him to leave his job, I thought this would get easier but it isn't, so I'm wondering about having the conversation with him."
"Holiday question","AIBU about the holiday? Apologies this is long but I want to give context and don’t want to drip feed. Had a baby in October so I’m on maternity leave. I’ve saved to be off on maternity leave and will be paying all my own bills. Partner paid for babies furniture. My mum bought the pram and next to me. His mum bought steriliser and cameras. I bought everything else. Me and partner have our own houses (mixture of reasons but that’s not the issue). We live in mine except when he has his son when he stays there (two nights per week). He cooks washes etc here but pays nothing towards costs. He can also be out of the house two nights per week on nights. He picks up a bit of overtime (two this week) but isn’t an issue for him because I’m the “childcare” so I feel like I can enable him to work more because I’m default parent. Overtime pay isn’t shared in any way. I pay for everything for baby bar some milk (partner buys 4 tins and I buy 2). The first month I fed baby myself. The second month we halved the milk, third month he bought 4 I bought 2. I buy all clothes, bottles, medicines (calpol etc) nappies, wipes, toiletries etc. We half our food shopping (I spend more than if I lived alone because he eats more but that’s life). Last time he done the shop he didn’t ask me if I wanted anything adding. When it was my turn he sent me a list of what he wanted, I didn’t ask him he just sent it. (Sounds petty I know. I’m giving context). Before we had baby I paid for more. He’d often ask me to pick up an extra shop if he was skint. I’d give him money when he was short. I’d borrow him money. I’d pay for trips and food (he did too but I think I paid more). He once asked me to get an extra shop because he had no money and then insisted we took his son out that weekend to an attraction and he also bought him a toy (just because). When we lived at his house I paid the gas and electricity. We both earn similar (about 5k dif maybe) Last week I made a few comments. “Oh baby needs some vests” silence. “Oh I’m gonna put an order in for wipes” silence. “I might order babies passport” (which brings me onto the question) silence. “Baby needs a bigger bath he’s outgrew newborn one” silence. On the four nights he’s not been here this week I’ve sent pic of baby in bath “we need a bigger bath” “lol”. I’ve ordered the bath and it’s here, by the way. Baby also has DDH so has been in a harness so I had to go out and buy some bigger vests/adapted vests. Now he’s in a different type he needed a bigger sleep bag/tog suit (and a spare!) . He’s not paid for any of it. He spends a fortune on his other son (I know a 5 year old gets more that’s not the issue) but this month alone he’s done out his bedroom. New bed and bedding (including duvets and pillows) and mattress. Furniture. 40” tv etc. We went out to an attraction on Sunday (cost dad £30 for the two of them plus McDonald’s). I just hung around. Then he went and bought son a £50 toy. A toy yes, £50 maybe not (or am I tight ha) We took him out again yesterday (wed) and the attraction was £46 for them (me and baby just hung around again). Plus lunch. So I don’t think it’s he doesn’t want to spend just thinks I should buy for baby. He’s also took child on a weekend away last month (think arena tickets and £50 on merchandise), me and baby did go and he paid for the hotel. I said I’d pay for food in the pub but he got up and paid. I said in the car how much was it I’ll send it. He said “£74 no £78” I said oh don’t forget the £4 I’ll send it. He said you don’t have to. But… put the receipt in the top of the changing bag even though he didn’t need to go into it because baby and me were in our own room. (But obv I’d find it there). I sent the money but didn’t mention it. I do not begrudge his other son and have bought him lots of clothes recently. Dad will also ask me to grab things when I’m in town for him (pjs. Socks. Gloves, specific food etc) but I’ve never asked for it back. we agreed he would pay me “maintenance” as per the cms calculator. But because I got paid last month I gave him it back. So literally he has paid for nothing bar two lots of milk (second lot hasn’t even arrived yet). I’ve started picking up baby food so I’ve got a supply (because … money) - he knows, hasn’t got any or offered to get any. So literally he hasn’t bought anything. We were in Morrisons earlier (him buying a load of crap we don’t need imo) and I was worried about the parking (my car) and didn’t want a ticket (because.. no money) and he said why don’t you move it. I said I would. He looked what shopping I had (four baby food, some aloli and rice which we both eat. He didn’t say oh I’ll get that give it here so I had to dash through the til on the way out (it was about £7). We had been for lunch, I had soup, he paid and I paid for the cakes. Think we only went because of the shit show of Valentine’s Day yesterday and he felt bad. I did say I didn’t mind eating at home. He also paid for pizza at the weekend.. he suggested then said I could get it on the way home. I frowned .. so he later ordered and paid. I paid for the food last time we went for lunch. While we were in the cafe today we seen his friend and partner who had a baby a few weeks before me. I asked when she was going back to work… she said TBC as they have three kids etc and her partner said we’re trying to get 12 months.. but she said it was money…. My DP said “I know it’s expensive isn’t it” 😳 😳 Last year we went on holiday (May) I was saving for maternity so we put it on my credit card on the basis he would pay it back. I paid for the airport parking and spends. We only went because I had a pop because he said he couldn’t afford to go but was going loads of places with friends (two festivals for a start), I said I’d go with family and he said no we will go together (prob thought he would look like a prick!) We have been planning a family holiday this year and he was saying he was paying. I thought fab, a small perk for me being on maternity (I get 40% tax taken off my 689 smp and I’m not entitled to CB) and paying for everything myself. He said a few times he was paying because I paid last year (but I didn’t. He agreed to pay it back). Anyways the other day he said about the holiday and I said I don’t think I’ll be able to afford it. He said he would pay. I said are you paying or is it instead of paying me back. He said he wouldn’t be able to do both so what would I prefer. I explained I could do with the money back. I’m only getting £400 a month. I have all my bills. My mortgage is going up £150. My car and home insurance is due and gas/elec is costing anywhere between £200 and £300. It’s looking like we won’t be getting our work bonus (which I was sort of banking on) He asked how much I wanted, I said the cost (£965- for context the holidays I was looking at were £600 each but he wanted this and it was lovely but I didn’t bully him into an expensive hol). He sent me the money this morning with a text “sent £965” no kisses. I didn’t say thanks just “ok I’ll pay it off” and he thumbsed up. He got around 1k overtime this month. He’s later said it’s because he thought I was being off because I didn’t text him night last night (i probably am- I’m pissed off doing more of my share of childcare and the money situation) but He has also dropped into convo today “have you paid your credit card”. Earlier in the year my dad said he would take us on holiday which id mentioned to DP. So I said to DP are you still going to take “older child” on holiday. he said yes. I said me and baby could maybe go with my parents but I feel cheeky my dad paying (still working at 68) but I could always pay him back and if we didn’t go there me and baby wouldn’t get a holiday. He said what so am I not coming? In addition to him taking his older son on holiday he is going on two lads holidays (and went to two festivals last year whilst I saved) so I think it’s a piss take for my parents to take him on holiday when he doesn’t want to take me… the person who picks up all the slack with childcare so he can earn more, pays all the bills and costs for his second child and has paid for all kinds over the years. In all honesty I could probably stretch to the holiday by either reducing my maternity or sticking it on my card but I’m pissed off now 😂 I don’t need any additional advice. LTB comments (although I’d not have to buy anything if I did cos I bought it all and I’m paying everything anyways). I know the situation is a joke but it’s about the holiday I can’t decide. So my AIbu (if you got this far 😂) Yes you are being unreasonable - a holiday is a luxury he doesn’t owe you a holiday. You could find a way to go but are cutting your nose off to spite your face. It’s between him and your parents if they want to take him on holiday. Baby is only four months old it’s not like you’ve paid everything for years. Stop being a brat! No you are not being unreasonable - he is taking the piss. He’s letting you pay for everything for his second child and you’re covering some of his living costs and he won’t pay for your holiday if you make him pay back what he owes. Fuck your parents paying for him when he can afford three holidays for himself but nothing for you."
"Spend or save?","Just wondering what others would do in my situation. Bought a starter home last year, just pre Liz Truss, 90% LTV, it’s a 5 year fixed rate mortgage on 2.5% which obviously I am feeling lucky about right now, but generally sharing everyone’s concern about where the economy is going. I’m getting a promotion in Sept that will amount to an extra £5k a year. What I WANT to do with this money is to go on a lovely holiday, because I sort of get the feeling that travel is only going to become harder and more expensive from here on, and I spend so long saving for the house, I would like a treat. On the other hand I’m wondering if I should be putting that extra money into overpaying the mortgage, as is no doubt sensible. I have an emergency fund, and no children. What would you do?"
"She didn't need to tell me my weight.","Just to vent as I can't share my frustration anywhere else... I went for my NHS health check yesterday, and specifically asked not to be told my weight. I said to the nurse that I've been obsessional about it in the past and it's better for me not to know, as it sets me off... In the other questions she saw that I do cardio exercise 6 days a week, and she could see from my measurements that I'm small. I didn't want to state outright that I have a long history of eating disorders. I thought she would gauge that from everything else I'd said. At the end of the appointment, on the card where she'd noted my BP, pulse, cholesterol etc she also wrote on my weight and BMI. She said ""Oh, I know you said you didn't want to know that, but..."" <tinkly laugh> Aibu to think this was not ok? Surely she would have some awareness of EDs? I'm trying so hard not to go back to the trap of weighing and feeling compelled to lose weight, but already I'm wondering if I might buy some scales just to shave off half a stone. I've fought this for 30 years and wish she had have listened to what I was telling her."
"Does no presents = doesn't care?","I've been with DH for 18 years, married for 15. I've just ordered another small Xmas present for him...just pants as his are worn and he won't replace himself. These will go with other small gifts like a book, lip balm, car ice scraper, you get the idea. As a wider extended family the adults do secret Santa and spend £50 on someone. This year I've bought for one of my BILs. My DH never participates in secret Santa and says he doesn't want anything. I don't want him to receive nothing, and the kids would care hence I buy these stocking filler gifts so he has stuff to open. He generally doesn't buy me anything. Every birthday (or xmas if I make a point) I get something I've told him to buy. He has no ideas. Doesn't know what I'd like or need. He just doesn't listen, though, because all of us comment on things on TV or adverts or whatever. He was watching a drone camera following cyclists a few months before his birthday and said he'd love a drone. So he got one. He was shocked but loves it, it'll be cool for family photos and playing down the park. Anyway over the years I have practical presents and things I've asked for. He doesn't buy household stuff so once I asked for a sideboard (cheap, not antique or anything!) and family chipped in. I really want an air fryer but can't justify it so might ask for my next birthday. But these shouldn't even be gifts in my opinion. Once on holiday he forgot my birthday altogether so eventually I toasted myself with my then toddlers at lunchtime. All he said was he lost track of dates because we were away! No real apology. So TL;DR...does the lack of thought mean he doesn't care? He does have good points, oftentimes I feel the bad outweighs the good but I'm not quite at LTB yet. But I just feel I'm not thought of or worth thinking of. Edited"
"How do I ask him to contribute to costs over Christmas","Just after some advice please. Been with my DP for 2.5 years, he is a wonderful kind man and generous to a fault. We don't yet live together due to logistics of life in middle age (work, kids schools etc) but he comes over a few evenings a week and I'll always cook tea for us all. Sometimes his DC (only has one) stays over on a weekend (2 lunches, one tea). This is included in my weekly shopping as part of my budget. I don't mind this at all as can easily cover it and I like to do it as they are guests in my house and we all get on like one big happy family. My DP is planning to stay with me over the Christmas holidays this year which will be 11 days in a row. Some of those days (maybe 3 or 4) his DC will be with us too. That makes 2 adults and 2 children (I have a DC too) over the Christmas holidays. As much as I would like to just provide all the food for us all my budget cannot stretch to this at all as my DP has a big appetite. I mentioned this to him and he said that's fine, he'd pay for all the food over the whole holidays. He would never want to see me struggle and is always happy to pay his way. I said no, we'll split the cost as I wouldn't feel comfortable accepting that much from him despite him really not having a problem doing it. (I was brought up to not accept generosity from people and my last LTR with my DC's dad was abusive and I would receive anger and stonewalling if I asked him to pay for shopping etc so I have anxiety issues over asking. My DP is aware of this. I also know this is my issue and do have counselling re past trauma issues). As I find it so hard to accept him paying anything as I feel (due to past issues) it should be me providing in my home. Just looking for some advice on how you would approach this and how you would propose to split the cost so that it's fair? (So I don't drip feed, we like different foods. I shop healthy and frugal, very little meat due to cost and he just buys what foods he likes and unhealthy stuff. He probably spends on just his food the same each week as I spend for myself and my DC in total a week. To add, he's happy to eat my healthy meals but does like his snacks around those, I don't buy snacks) Thanks for any advice. Please be kind with it too as this is something that makes me anxious."
"To ask you to tell me some good things about your significant other.","In this world of conflict and cries of LTB let's celebrate the good ones by saying three things about our wife, husband or partner. I'll go first; He takes 50% of childcare and housework and life administration without being asked. He notices if I'm struggling or shattered and buys me a ticket to a gig or picks up my share of the slack. He loves and physically takes care of people such as his mum, friends and our son."
"To ask for strategies/help calling out for lazy dh","Dh has really fucked me off this morning. There's not much of a marriage left, we're in this in-between state of clinging on hoping to get back what we had and one of us being too afraid to end it. We do generally get on OK as friends but I've ended up with an extra child not a partner. We have 2 young dc, stressful lives outside of parenting Inc work and our own parents health. It's hard. I have 100% of the mental load, I'm the only one with any motivation to do things around the house. Anytime I call him out he turns it on me and makes me out to be a nag I need some one liners or strategies or just anything advice to keep me sane please. I know ltb is the ultimate solution but its something that'll take a few years to achieve. He makes me out to be a nag and mocks me when I ask him to do things. I only have to ask because he doesn't 'see' what needs done. And even when I point it out, it can sometimes take weeks for the task to be done. I hate this being turned on me and him making me the problem."
"Leaving TB","Partner has a problem with alcohol which has become much worse since our DD was born almost two years ago. We are currently away at a family function (my family), he got pretty drunk, we left at around 8:30pm then snuck out to go to a bar whilst I was putting DD to sleep. I told him at the beginning of the night I saw he was drinking too much, too fast and please slow down as I was getting anxious about the way the evening would pan out. I've told him this evening (among many other things) that one of us needs to break the cycle and since he can't (by not giving up booze) then I'm done. Apparently I have too high standards and I'm controlling too. I've also not been affectionate and he has needs that aren't being fulfilled. The last few months I've paid off a few grand of debt of his, added him to life insurance scheme through work, encouraged him to contact GP over a cancer scare etc. But I'm just not caring or showing him any love so that's why he's drinking. So I know I need to LTB but how do I do it? We have to pack and drive home tomorrow morning (I'll do the driving!), I don't know if I'll be strong enough to stick to my guns but this ""drunk-beg forgiveness-promise I'll do better"" cycle is endless. I really need help, I've been awake since 5:30 and now can't sleep due to being so upset. Partner has thrown up (in the loo this time, better than when he threw up on the new hat I bought DD a few weeks ago) and fallen asleep on the sofa. And yet wonders why I've not been very affectionate lately... If I don't post again tonight it's because I've finally fallen asleep but I need to write this down so I can read it again in the cold light of day. Thank you mumsnet for being here ❤️"
"Partner has upset me","Some slow burn upset has crept upon me this morning. Bf and I went to a party this past weekend where some of my relatives attended. On the way I was trying to describe who would be there, which children belonged to which cousin/aunt etc. As I was doing this, he interjected with ""Oh, I know. The one whose kids are soft."" It took me a second to realise what he meant at first, as I was driving and focusing on the road, but what who he was referring to were my relations with autism. He called them soft. I didn't have much time to react, as again - driving. But also this was said not far from us arriving to our destination and I didn't want to ruin the children's party by having a face like thunder and causing drama so I swallowed it down and got on with things. But on the drive home I kept thinking about it, and I started feeling upset. I can't imagine saying that about someone in the first place, let alone about the relative of someone you're in a LTR with? What made it worse, is I am currently waiting to be diagnosed as an adult with autism, so I am panicking now if I do get that diagnosis, will he think that of me too? Or am I just overreacting and being defensive of my family? We have had issues before where he has implied that my diagnosis may be used as a get out of jail free card, and I'll use it as an excuse, when really, I just want to know wtf is going on inside of my head. So this has added further dimension to that. We've been together for nearly 10 years now, house, anniversary this week. And on top of all of our other issues this feels like the cherry on top of the shit sundae that is our relationship at the minute. :( What do you think? Am I being a baby here?"
"Is that ok to say that?","Don’t know anymore… Dh has told me several times now ‘if you have a problem with that, then do it yourself’. Context: I’m chronically ill and have been bad for about 1.5years. By that I mean I’m lying down 22 hours a day. Can’t get up etc… cardiologist involved but so far it hasn’t made a huge difference. I just cannot physically get up and prepare a meal etc… or not Wo a huge cost to me. Last time DH made that comment it was around a joke I made (done many many times before) that I ‘should put a complaint’ because there was fish bones in a fish. I mean even dc who is on the spectrum knew it was a joke and not an attack on DH cooking. I never say anything about his cooking anyway. Another time was about moving house and DH deciding we would move to <name of town>. And being told that I’d have to move there because ‘you can’t stay here on your own anyway’. Now I understand having to suddenly do the whole HW/cooking etc… is a pain for him. Esp after years of me doing it all . But it very much feels like ‘shut up and put up with it’ because you’re disabled so don’t have a say. I can’t see the wood for the trees anymore. Could you tell me if you think this is ok to say that and why? Or why you don’t feel it’s ok to talk to me like this?"
"Meatballs as far as the eye can see!","I have (another!) culinary slip up and I need some ideas for tonight’s dinner! DS loves Swedish meatballs and we keep a big bag in the freezer for him as a quick meal when needed. Unfortunately 2 nights ago he put them in the fridge, not the freezer…. I’ve just discovered them so think I probably need to use them tonight…..it says on the pack not to re-freeze. We had spaghetti and meatballs two nights ago so I don’t really just want to do a variation of that. Any ideas what I could make with them instead? Could I mash them up and make something totally different?? My brain has gone blank and online I’m just finding variations of meatballs with pasta, which I know I could do. Also DD doesn’t like “meatballs” but does eat burgers, cottage pie etc so might eat them if they were presented differently…. It’s a huge brand new bag as well so there’s TONS of the bastard things…. Can anyone help with inspiration? I’d be very grateful. YABU: just cook them with spaghetti again YANBU: No, do something different and here’s my fabulous recipe <insert idea here pleeeeeeease>"
"Advice on dating after LTR","So, separated a few months now after a very long relationship, kids etc... In reality the relationship was on the rocks over a year ago and we lived quite separate lives last year. Anyway, back dating and met up with someone a couple of times over the last week. Had an amazing 2nd date, 3rd tomorrow and there is definitely a mutual connection. Both late 40s, both have kids but I do have a couple of questions: Is it too soon to buy flowers (3rd date) - I would like to but worried that looks a bit keen. Also, without jumping the gun, when do people look to go exclusive? Looking around it seems a lot of advice is 3 months which for me is far too long? Assuming the 3rd and 4th date go well, I would like to think that is the time to not look at other dates?"
"LTR/Marriage and mis matched sex drives","So this is just a thought provoking and interested in opinions thread. The other day I was talking to a friend who was telling me about a friend of hers thats just found out her husband has been having an affair. It transpires that this couple had only had sex a handful of times in the last 5 years and nothing for the last two years, she didn't want to and had basically made him celibate. My response was along the lines of no excuse for an affair, leave if you're unhappy, but what did she expect. Anyway this got me thinking that the biggest reason for any (otherwise normal) LTR/marriage break up and/or affair is a mis matched sex drive between the couple. Whether both of you are at it like rabbits or both are rarely interested in more than a cuddle, surely being on the same page as far as sex goes is the key to couples staying together for many years. Just interested to hear others thoughts on this one"
"To think I’m past the point of being able to get pg?","I’m 43. Two DC conceived in my twenties. Termination at 34, MC at 37, MC at 41. So it’s been nearly 10 years since I conceived a viable pregnancy (at least it was viable up until the point of termination). MCs were very early, around the 6 week mark. After my last MC I had a copper coil fitted, which was a nightmare - agonising periods, which went on for ages. And terrible problems with BV. I had it for about 8 months and couldn’t take it any longer. Since then, so the last 16 months or so, I started just avoiding my most fertile times as a way of avoiding pregnancy. But over that time I’ve definitely entered peri and my periods are all over the shop now, I don’t know if my cycle will be 2 weeks or 5 months! So it’s kind of impossible to know when I’m going to ovulate. To begin with, when they first started becoming irregular, it transpired that my ovulation time was right around when I’d been having a lot of sex, but hadn’t got pregnant. So I’d tried to avoid fertile times but accidentally did the opposite, but only realised when my period arrived. And I admit that, once this had happened a fair few times I became a bit complacent about the fact that I just won’t get pregnant. Trust me, I have exhausted all types of contraception and none of them work for me, the only one I could use is condoms. But if I’ve been having regular (like a lot of times a week) unprotected sex for 16 months, at my age, and no sign of pregnancy at all, it’s pretty unlikely to happen, isn’t it? I feel like if I was WANTING to conceive, that’s what I’d be told! I am in a LTR and whilst a pregnancy wouldn’t be the end of the world, I’d rather it didn’t happen. Edited"
"Ended my relationship - AIBU?","I am just looking for other to give their opinions on my relationship experience. I'm wondering if I'm right/wrong/unreasonable/impatient/etc? So I met a man at about the same time he separated from his wife - bad timing right? It was very intense from the start, he had feelings quickly. I questioned the validity of them and tried to temper his advances. Managed this (with a lot of back and forth) for around 6 months. It didn't work, I also gave in to my feelings and we began our relationship, which lasted for a year. His ex did not take his leaving their marriage well at all (3 kids < 10) and has made it her life mission to make his life impossible to move on with. I'd not be thrilled either, but he's not a bad man, and she has definitely fuelled the end of their marriage with her behavior by sounds of it. She has flat out refused ANY discussion since separating (1.5 years) regarding children, house selling, finances and everything else, ignores the legal letters. He doesn't love her and I dont believe she loves him - she just doesn't want her nice life bankrolled by him to change (she earns less than him and would have to make some major adjustments to lifestyle). He has always been very sure of me, good communicator, so loving and caring, loads of lovely time spent together. I was so crazy about him, and vice versa (or so I thought). I have met his family and some friends, but he had not told her about us (a year in...) as he anticipated that she would go nutty , and it would be further ammunition for her to bash him to the kids and with hold them further. I feel as though I've been holding his hand throughout this process, continually motivating him and trying to help him see his worth as a man and as a father. He's been thankful and appreciative but I just don't feel like he's had a goal in mind, or considered what he actually needs to do to move forward. She will not allow him the kids overnight and if she says he's not seeing them X week, then that's it, he's s just not seeing them. He says these things take time to sort out, but how long does he expect me to wait /remain in the shadows. It is clear to me (and basically everyone else) that even with the best will in the world, he won't be able to get this sorted without assistance of a court. The ex wont allow him a fair split financially or custody wise....at this point hes essentially done everything he can, but still won't go to court. I just wont understand how he can stand to ask permission to see/have his kids and even the bare minimum is too much to ask. I have left him as I don't think he is commited to our future together. I'm so disappointed and upset over it, but what else can I do? Ive tried so hard to help him. I love him dearly, and I know he loves me but the strain on our relationship is so crippling. I'm questioning his character and losing respect for him."
"Should I clear DHs debt with savings or take another card out for him to keep paying it back so he takes full responsibility for his mistake?","DH has a credit card with £4.5k on it though it's in my name as my credit rating is a lot better than DHs, though so far he has made all payments towards it. It was a balance transfer at 0% for 18 month, DH has only managed to get it down for £4.5k from £7k during that term. I have been on maternity leave so have been unable to save anything to put towards it, I returned to work a few months ago. There is no question that this is DHs debt, not mine. Long story short, he made a poor business decision that backfired massively and I took out the balance transfer card for him as he was paying over £100 a month in interest alone and he couldn't get one himself. I earn a lot more than DH and now that I have returned to work I have been able to save some money. Maternity leave ate all our savings so I went back with very little left over. However, I am projected to have saved £4000 by the time the 0% period comes to an end in April. DH should be able to cover the last £500 himself and it would clear the debt. I could then concentrate on starting to save up for us again. DH works very hard and we split bills proportional to our income. But despite paying a lot more towards our bills, I still end up with more 'spare money' than DH does which we don't split, we just put in savings and they are for the family but technically, it's my money. It's a bit of a bone of contention that we don't just split money all from one pot but DH is self employed, in a partnership and doesn't have a business bank account so it's very hard to work out exactly what is his money and what is the business' money so it has been his choice to agree what he needs to contribute towards family bills but otherwise keep our finances separate even though he'd definitely have more disposable income for himself if we split it but there we are. So I have saved this money but I do consider it 'our' money. I don't want to take out another 0% balance transfer card as honestly it just irritates me being in my name and sat there every time I open my banking app reminding me what a mess DH let himself get into before he told me how deep he'd got himself. But he simply cannot afford to clear it himself and I can. I also doubt DHs credit rating is good enough to take out such a high card on a long term 0% deal now either. So if we did do this, it would still have to be in my name. Do I just suck it up and pay it off and be done with it or do I take out another card and let DH keep paying it back, incredibly slowly. I'm annoyed at DH no end but really want to be clear; he is a good man, a good dad and a good husband. He works very hard and pays what he can and earns enough that his contribution to our family finances does contribute to our quality of life. He just made a bad mistake and got overwhelmed by it. He didn't tell me what was happening because I was pregnant and very unwell in pregnancy and he was hoping he could sort it before he had to worry me, this didn't happen obviously. So please no 'LTB'. Just genuinely, what should I do? Pay it off with our savings or let DH keep paying slowly on another card in my name?"
"Invasion of privacy - both upset","Both in early 50's and LTR. Due to work and personal trips my DH and I have only spent 3 days together in the last 4+ weeks (not a regular thing - just happened this way). He has been home 2 nights. Last night I came from work and could tell he was in a mood - we had the house to ourselves as our DS was out for a few hours, so there was an expectation we would have some time alone together - and yes, sex for the first time in 3 weeks. However he then told me that he had found (as he put it) loads of sex toys under my bed. I bought a clitoral stimulator a few weeks ago, for various reasons - he was away for 3 weeks, I've never liked vibrators and was intrigued to know what these did, and also I am not quite like I used on this department (not just sexually but with general pelvic floor strength and have an appointment with a pelvic floor physio booked in a weeks time). It was under the bed and zipped away in a cosmetics bag. His reaction to finding this has not been great. He has got all defensive about how it is just ""not like me"", that it must be because he can't please me (not true - I think we have a good sex life - we are just not 20 any more), but more than that essentially accused me of having an affair (he has over the years asked me if there is anyone else on multiple occasions - i have never given him any reason to doubt my fidelity). He even started gong on about a pair of shorts he found in the bedroom that weren't his (they are mine), saying ""you don't wear shorts"" !!??? We spoke for a bit afterwards and I felt it was a bit better - however, I don't believe for one second that we wasn't snooping - his reason for being there does not ring true to me, and I also felt I had to tell him about seeing the pelvic health specialist - something that I didn't want to discuss until I had had my appointment. There was also an incident a few weeks ago when he opened a letter to me from the hospital. I was away at the time and he told me - but I was really upset he did this - there was not reason for him to open this. When I explained that I was trying to get ""it all"" working like it used to - he said he couldn't see why i needed sex toys for that. I know this may make him feel not nice, and a threat to him but I am really upset by his reaction and snooping. I don't feel (if we have a regular sex life) that what I do by myself is any of his business. He also made a little ""quip"" in the evening of ""are you coming to join me or stay an play with your toy"" - said it was a joke but feel it is totally guilt tripping and shaming. For context - he is not a prude, I know he has watched loads of porn over the years (don't know if he still does) and has bought me vibrators in the past (I just didn't like them). He ended up getting up after a few hours and sleeping in the next room and then was just off with me this morning before we both went to work. Whilst I can appreciate he might not feel great about this I am really upset that I feel he is guilt tripping and punishing me for this. The people pleaser in me wants to make him feel better, but I also feel I need to stand my ground on my right to privacy (I do sometimes feel he has a sense of ownership towards me as I am his wife). Feeling rather numb about it all"
"Husband angry all the time","Any advice mumsnetters? My husband seems to be permanently angry. At me. At our dc. At his colleagues at work. At his mum. So fed up with it. Am wondering if this is a sign of a mid life crisis? Does anyone have any tips to make life easier other than LTB?!!"
"What got you through your breakup?","NC for this. Recently ended a LTR with a partner whom I'm currently in the process of trying to buy out (Still living together). I haven't been heartbroken since I was 17! So all these emotions feel so raw to me and my precious breakup took me 3 years to get over because it ended so drastically (Christmas Day). As it's my decision, I'm hoping it won't be half as bad as my previous experience but I'm going to have to live on my own for the first time and accept losing mutual friends. How on earth am I going to cope?"
"Sulking husband","Name change for this. Married 10 years. 2 young children. Busy jobs etc etc. My sex drive is basically non-existent. A combination of tiredness and uro-gynae issues (that I am under a specialist for) and if I'm honest no sexual attraction to my husband. But we still generally have sex about once a week. That isn't enough for my husband. He does this incredibly annoying thing when he gropes me when I am sleeping - squeezing my bum, boobs etc. I've repeatedly told him not to do this. It makes me feel really uncomfortable and as not to drip feed I was in an abusive relationship years ago when this type of thing happened and I basically just had to lie there while this guy had sex with me. That relationship has definitely given me an uncomfortable relationship/view on sex. My husband knows this!! Also my husband has been caught on sex hook-up websites although he's never acted on it??? So he says. But that's another reason I think I struggle with a sexual relationship. A couple of nights ago I was woken up with his fingers probing my vagina. I told him to stop which he did. But he's been in a mood with me ever since. Yesterday evening I brought it up and told him that I have asked him on many occasions not to do this. Can't he realise it makes me feel incredibly uncomfortable. His reply was ""can't I realise he's a sexual being"". He then stomped off and we've not spoken since. Our relationship hasn't been great for a while. I think I want us to break up but there's just so many practicalities in the way. And the relationship isn't awful. AIBU for telling him to stop touching me in my sleep and is his annoyance validated? Some practical advice would be great rather than a million LTB. Thank you"
"To put up a Christmas Tree tonight?","I just made a miserable AIBU so here's a less heavy one: I really want to put uo the tree because it's pretty :,) is it too early? (It's fake, 7foot and has fake now and berries 0<0)"
"Completely confused by what's normal regarding contact from friend who is in a LTR","My friend who I work with texts me every night and sometimes before work. I'm recently single. Texts range from work chat to idle chat to sending inappropriate reels of funny/sexy/ innuendo type of thing. These texts have increased since I've become single so I've reduced contact a little as it feels like he wants his ego stroking . He doesn't mention his partner of several years and he has only ever introduced her to me once. They live together. He has discussed their relationship in depth in the past but as previously said, doesn't mention her anymore. So am I correct? Is he looking for an ego rub or is he lonely or just enjoying the banter. I've no sexual interest in him. In fact I find I'm trying to distance myself at work as he will often pop into my office and sit himself at the edge of my desk for a chat. Or perhaps he feels he can be friendlier or make more contact given that my relationship is over? Odd one ?"

"Response to request to state pronouns","There have been a number of threads about how to respond if you're asked or required to state your pronouns. One of them mentioned an interesting concept whose name I've forgotten. I haven't been able to find the thread and wondered if anyone can tell me what this concept is called. It was called ""stereotype <something>"". It means that people can tend to live up to stereotypes about their sex, race etc - for example, that women aren't good at maths. In the case of pronouns, it means if you're female and have to give pronouns that make that clear, it reinforces your femaleness and you might then live up to the stereotype that you're not good at maths. What was this concept called? I thought it would be a good thing to mention if anyone tries to force me to state my pronouns."
"Mortgage and childcare","We’re currently in the process of selling our place and hopefully moving into a bigger sized property, but we’ve ran into an issue with our mortgage. At present, we do not pay for childcare as I’m on maternity leave and then they will be looked after by my mum and me taking AL, but we’ve not yet decided (or even signed up to a nursery) if they will go part time once my AL runs out. The bank is asking for any future outgoings and childcare is one of them. As we’ve said we don’t know if this will change yet they’ve asked for an estimated amount if we did pay for childcare (estimated £700 per month based on daily rates). This is reducing the amount they would lend us by £100k, meaning we won’t be able to buy the house! Our LTV is 50%, if they offered us the full amount we owe, so we’re in a good financial position on the house. How is this even fair? We’ve not even decided if we will go through with a nursery place, so how can we be penalised by this when it may not even happen!"
"Worried my lazy CF mat leave cover will make me redundant?","Sorry this is super long but don’t want to drip feed. I've been fortunate enough to have a 3 month handover period with my maternity leave cover before I go on leave in March. To set the scene, I work in the UK, but remotely in a global role in marketing - my colleagues are all over the world. I am subject to UK employment laws. My concern is that a lazy/underperforming mat leave cover may look really bad for my role while I'm away, and given it is a known thing that restructuring is happening, I'm worried about my position. If the cover doesn't perform/makes my position look bad/redundant (i.e. not producing anything of value) I worry my role will be made redundant. A lot of my job is self directed but what I produce adds value. My cover is someone from an agency our company uses (rather than a maternity contract position). I had no say in my cover, my manager went for this option as it was cheaper than hiring a contractor. She lives in another part of the world. When I come online at 9, it's the last two hours of her day (3-5pm). I asked her at the start of Nov whether she was 100% allocated to this role, and she said yes. I've been handing over and training up the cover for almost one month. This involves a 2 hour meeting where I go through work that I do and she shadows/I talk her through it, or direct training with training decks and documentation, and sometimes joining meetings I attend. That would lead me to expect that she has another 6 hours to fill in the day - 4-5hrs if I'm being generous with multiple breaks in the day. At first I was a bit daunted as I didn't know how I was going to fill her other 6 hours. But now I'm very much feeling on the other end of the spectrum... I share a list of bite size tasks, exercises, training videos, documentation for her to do that is the outcome of our daily meetings, with the expectation that she can EASILY complete these in the 9am-3pm window she has the next day before our meeting. I am not exaggerating when I say most of these activities should not take more than 30 minutes each (a VERY generous estimate - some are 5 minute jobbies), maybe in total over the month there have been 2-3 activities which could take roughly an hour (as in, watch a training video or a recorded meeting). I would ask the next day how she went with X,Y,Z activities, did she have any questions, and most of the time, nothing has been done for a few days. This pattern of behaviour consistently for a month! At any given point, there would not have been more than 3 activities to do. We end up doing some of the activities together in our meeting, because I'm actually stuck and can't move forward with a piece of work until it's been done, and I want to harness the teaching opportunity/get her to get get hands on, rather than do it myself which might take me <5 minutes (think editing a Facebook post from ""2023"" to ""2024"" or something small to this effect). It's not even that she attempts to do it and is stuck - that is not a problem, I genuinely love teaching and helping my colleagues. I want to see her succeed. I am despairing because NOTHING has been done because she has been busy 'running errands', or going to 'appointments' (6 hours worth of appointments in one day??) , or sick kids. I get it with the sick kids and had empathy for this (have my own), and in my head I've written them off as a Carer's Leave days, but why are you running errands or decorating your house for Christmas (yes she told me this!?) on company time? I'm in an awkward position because I'm not her manager - I'm just the person who is handing over to her. I am not here to performance manage. I am 100% sure that this attitude will continue over into the year I'm taking out for maternity leave, and not even the bare minimum will get done without lots of reminders and prompting from others. My manager is super hands off, trusts me to get on with my responsibilities, and doesn't really like to get involved in performance/conflict/confrontation etc. He will probably ask me when we catch up how the handover is going, and I plan to tell him that it's slow going because of the various disruptions, and that I'm struggling to understand why she is unable to complete (VERY generously estimating) 1-2 hours worth of tasks, when she has 6 hours to spare in the day. I want to say that I'm concerned about how this will reflect on my role when I'm away. I don’t think he will do any performance management whilst I’m away, it is just not his style. I would be grateful to MN to give any advice on Whether there is any law in the UK that would protect my role from being made redundant whilst I am on maternity leave, especially if it is related to the performance of my cover? Any thoughts on how to approach (and continue to communicate) this issue with my manager? Any ideas on how to protect myself/role (e.g. I've just started to try and keep a log of the 'busy running errands' and 'decorating' comments - which feels really petty from me but not sure what else to do) Anything else would be really helpful. I really like my job, and really worried it's all going to turn to sh*t when I'm away and my cover makes my role look useless. The main thing is, I don't want to role to be made redundant because it looks like it isn't contributing anything of value for a year. Thanks in advance!"

Success rates were poor. -Business manager was pushing for more patients (60% instead of 35%) to have invasive ICSI as it was more profitable. Without clinical indications. -Lab manager was reporting all the problems but she was being ignored. She was asking for the workload to be reduced but instead, business manager was asking for it to be increased for profits. How can this not be all over the news??"
"To park this life goal for now","TL,DR: house buying in current times !! Everyone talking about how rates are soaring. An article I saw yesterday saying FTBs will now pay over 10k in interest on average was the final straw. Apparently your actual equity would only account for 30% of the astronomically large payments. We have a deposit saved away in ISA but would still need a 95% (possibly 90) LTV so is a high risk for negative equity(owing more to the bank than the value of the house). This will matter and might come back to bite us as like most (all) people getting onto the ladder we can’t afford the home we’ll live in forever straight away, sadlynot practical for us We rent in a beautiful village where everyone knows one another and there is zero risk of being evicted, and payments will only go up by nominal amounts. So lucky for this. Is being a homeowner worth it if you’re compromising on other areas of life ?? It’s always been my goal but lately I’ve been thinking we might as well enjoy life a bit more rather than being so house poor and maxing out our budget. A low deposit and an extremely long term is essentially renting from the bank with all the drawbacks of property maintenance, right ? Just sounds like the opposite of secure to me Even thinking now DH and I could make the best of our little home despite being rented and start our family here given we would then have a larger amount of disposable income to help buffer reduced income over maternity, then later childcare fees (although we will only need one full day of paid childcare anyway). We earn equally and I do intend to go back to work FT and love my job. Maybe this is illogical as lenders would then lop more off our affordability for dependant, though DHs salary should be on the rise over the next several years with commission and enhancements anyway. I do see my attitude might be wrong but trying to be considered based on the research I have done, and other threads read on here"
"Marriage/LTR v weekend life","AIBU to think that some men and women leave a LTR when family life gets dull or demanding … to have an alternate life, with child free time and no life stresses with a new partner may seem appealing?"
"I've screwed up my relationship","Help me make sense of my head please. I don't know what i want. I've been in a LTR for 10 years now and most of it has been absolutely brilliant. The sex is OK though, i've never had an orgasm, but I was OK with that - mostly. Everything else was fantastic. We are perfect together. We're now long distance for his work (he's abroad) and it's been two years now. I don't know what I want any more - last time I stayed with him I felt that I didn't fancy him any more and his hygiene had dropped and and weight gain put me off (hadn't seen each other for 6 months before). I felt we were becoming platonic. It's from my side though, he still feels the same about me. He has health problems and gets very emotionally sensitive, so I've never really told him any of the things that bother me because he can't deal with it. I've been keeping my feelings inside for so long that I think they've built up and I can't deal with it any more. I feel like a fraud - I love him so much and so deeply and we are best friends, but I feel like I'm lying because I'm not as attracted as I once was. I've been ignoring it. Being far away from each other has aided to ignoring problems. Since he's been away I've been completely faithful, but in my head I've been fantasising about others (mostly actors, famous ppl etc), no one I know in person. I get really horny but not for him - for a fantasy figure in my head! I'm also going through peri and feeling drier down there but still horny? Anyone else gets this, it's so frustrating! This is adding to my confusion as to what I want. I don't get this horny with him - but is this the menopause and will it pass? He's always thought I have a low sex drive - I've never been hugely sexual IRL (not many partners) but lately the horniness has been off the scale, but it's not for him. Will it pass?? it's not normal for me to feel like this all the time! Here's the problem - I've always told him I wanted to get married and we've talked about it a bit over the years but never done it. Now he wants to get married but last night I told him I was unsure - perhaps it's too soon, we should wait till he's back in the country etc. He planned to come over one weekend for us to get engaged but when we were talking about it last night all of a sudden it's like I got cold feet! Even though we've talked about it for weeks and I was looking forward to it, I told him he shouldn't be spending money coming over now and we should wait till he's back in this country for good (in a few months time) and then get engaged. In my head I've always thought that marriage was the be all and end all, I always thought that being married would solve all my problems and once it's done I will feel 'settled'. He's my absolute best friend and very kind and caring so why have I reacted like this? Am I just 'throwing him away' because I have too high expectations, or should I stay with him, with someone who understands me, has always been there for me and makes me feel safe and cosy? I'm in my 50s so my chances of someone new are slim so am I being just completely stupid and full of myself? Anyway I've really, really hurt him and he isn't answering my calls. I'm sure he thinks I'm 'messing him about' but that was never my intention. How do i fix this? I don't know what I want. What is wrong with me?? But the LAST thing I ever wanted is to hurt him but I've done that now. The thought of us actually ending is scaring me, I've been crying on and off all day. The thought of us breaking up is terrifying to me, but the thought of getting engaged gave me cold feet!?? I don't expect anyone to have any answers to be honest ,except that I need therapy! But if you've managed to read this far, I commend you and thanks."
"Husband waking me up!","I am an insomniac, rarely getting more than 3-4 hours sleep. Yesterday, I was awake from 3am. I was reading in bed and fell back to sleep at 8:30. I was woken up at 9:00, by my husband coming in to the bedroom. ""Oh good, you're awake"" he said. ""I'm just going to hoover through upstairs"". He was still hoovering at 10:00, not just floors, but curtains, skirting boards, and even the cornices. I was not best pleased! Later he asked if I was cross with him, and if so, why. I told him he had woken me up. He denied this and said I was already awake. AIBU in thinking an apology would have been nice, even if he was mistaken about having woken me? Should I LTB, or is this a patio job given my extreme lack of sleep?"
"Moving out but staying together?","Hello all, this is a follow on from an earlier post of mine. My fiance and I are 27 and have been dating for 5 years and engaged for 4. We've been living together for 3 years in my parents house due to financial reasons. When we first moved in, everything was great, even now things are good, but there have been some issues such as lack of sexual intimacy due to some issues, lack of quality time, and even though I don't question our love for each other, a general - feeling like roommates rather than a relationship- feeling. As we're living at my parents house, we're pretty much locked up in a single room, so you can guess how on top of each other we are. Despite these issues, otherwise we are pretty rock solid. We've never fought, we communicate our issues and we take care of each other physically and emotionally. Things came to a head last week and told him that I was thinking about if a break for us would be a good idea. A sort of reset. He completely agreed and understood my reasoning behind it and saw it as a good opportunity for us. We're now waiting on getting some help on family to help him move back to his parents. The plan is for us to take a month without visiting each other while we still communicate regularly. Then we'll ""reset"" and see each other three times a week - life permitting and that will carry on until we can afford a place of our own. This will give us time to work on ourselves and re-establish some indepandancy, give us more room for ourselves. We're hoping this will bring a spark back and make us see this relationship and what we have together in a new light. Here's the kicker, even though this was my idea, I'm terrified. I'm begining to regret bringing the whole idea up in the first place. It feels like such a step back for us. I know it's what we need, we needed things to change, but I'm just so anxious about it all. I'm just really sad about the whole thing and will miss him alot. If anyone has some good happy ending stories / reassure me that I did the right thing, please comment Thank you <3"
"Husband and his sisters!","bith Have never made any effort with me or our kids. I used to send birthday cards to his sisters and the kids every year then I stopped, when I had a girl they made do many sexist remarks of how unlucky I was (culturally boys preferred). They also as I made horrible comments if we were back in our home country we could easily have gotten “rid” of our daughter without any issues! That is just the top of the iceberg. They have made so many other hurtful comments. DH btw always remained silent and MIL refused her daughters would say that and called me a liar (DH could have backed me up as he was there but his response was “why do u always want to be right? Ignore it we know the truth). After 7 years of this I completely stopped talking to them. Funny thing is the incident that led to to me stop talking was on my sons birthday they completely ignored me and my kids and that’s the moment I thought “fuck it” I haven’t spoken to them for 4 years now. This has caused conflict with DH and myself. I refuse up have them at kids parties as they make remarks and bitch about people. we moved into our new home and DH has said I’m not allowed any family or friends (not that I have any due to the depression these bastard have caused me) to come over unless his sisters visit first. On my birthday my sisters and I met up in a Restarant and he stormed off saying “you would never sit around chatting with my sisters would you?”. I feel like I’m living in a demented world, has he not seen what they did to me and my kids? how to move past this and live my life? He won’t let me be happy till I make up with his sisters. My family will never see our new home till he lets them and his condition is I make up with them. Please no LTB If it was that easy I found have already and not posted here!"
"To think some things are always posted on here","I don’t mean LTB, spa day etc, but links. Like to the Philip Larkin poem if someone is posting about their parents or to the Elle Beau blog every time someone mentions an MLM. I get fooled thinking it’s something new and interesting every time. There are others … what are there?"
"Is this ‘normal’","LTP and I have been together for 20 years. Three children. Been in couples counselling with a view to them attempting to be more Accomadation when I talk about the children and how I struggle. One has physical dis. When I say struggle, possibly every 6 weeks get stressed/ sad for an hour as have to do lots of physical tasks for child with needs and feel sad about their future. LTP has been a bit better recently and I thought I was coming back to having some feelings. Began to trust them. Now LTP has been useless again and I am devastated by the response I have had . I have wanted to be alone all day he has left me alone and doesn’t want to talk. feel like I can’t keep trusting to have my trust broken. Has anyone ever managed to come back from feeling like this. ."
"Arguments over Money","I’m going to start by saying although I know there will be lots of LTB comments and I have looked into it, but it’s just not a practical option for me right now. I really need to vent here because I don’t want to drag real life people into things. There is me, my husband and a daughter, 12. Back story: My husband hasn’t worked in five years because he stopped work in his mid fifties and has been drawing on his pension ever since. When he stopped work he announced that he was never working again. I am twelve years younger than my husband and I work full time. I earn several hundred pounds a more each month than he gets in pension so he considers me to be rich. However, he does just about manage to still engage in an expensive hobby and has various loans and credit cards that he is paying off. Last year I ended up paying for our summer holiday in full because, although he agreed to pay half when it was booked, when the time to pay the balance came he said he had no money. I had no choice but to pay, but said that he should provide all the spending money to make up some of the difference. On the holiday he complained loudly every time he was asked to buy just a drink and some evenings he refused to buy a single drink. After the holiday he did not stop going on about how much he had spent and how it wasn’t fair that he had to spend so much. He only spent 10% to 20% of what I paid for the holiday. So, this year I said that I wasn’t prepared to pay for him to go on holiday. I suggested that just DD and I went away but she felt funny about it. I wrangled with my husband and said that he just had to pay for himself, I would pay for me and DD. He promised and promised me that he would pay up. I paid for extras like better flight times and the airport lounge without asking for him to share the cost. I told him that he needed to contribute half the spending money. I’m offering no prizes for guessing what happened. At balance time he gave me half the cost of his own ticket and on the holiday begrudgingly paid for a few coffees. So I paid for me, DD, half of his ticket, activities, evening drinks etc. I am seething. But what has capped it off today is we had to buy a particular outfit for DD because she is taking part in his brother’s wedding next week. We had lunch while we were out, I said I couldn’t afford much as I’m living on fresh air for the rest of the month following the holiday costs. He dismissed this, took us to Wagamama and was annoyed when I wouldn’t pay. He also wanted me to pay for the outfit but as it’s his brother’s wedding I don’t see that it is my cost to bear. This evening he is complaining that I am less than generous! And he told me this evening that keeping the house clean and tidy isn’t a man’s job! So apparently I should work full time, pay for everything and do all the housework. He tells me I am always angry - I wonder why that would be!"
"Understanding the mental load","Hi everyone, I am really struggling with my partner to engage with me emotionally and understand the mental load. He does a lot for me practically, helps with work and will go out of his way in this area, e.g. does all the cooking. He works 9-5 and I am freelance with often very intense jobs, and also have ADHD which means that I really do need practical help to just get through life at times. However, he doesn't understand that I take on all the mental load of the relationship. I organise our social life, events, holidays, etc. in addition, whilst he does help with jobs, I often need to ask or still be involved so the mental load isn't removed. Most importantly I seem to be completely responsible for our emotional connection. He is very emotionally unavailable, hates talking about anything and doesn't understand that practical help doesn't make up for a complete absence of emotional help. Our sex life is crap and he can be very distant, won't ask me questions etc and I feel very lonely. I appreciate that one way out of this is to break up. This is our second try, so I know I can be strong here if I need to. However I would really like to try and get through to him. He's not doing it on purpose - he's quite damaged from childhood and from having to look after himself and his siblings so he just doesn't know how. I'm going to look at counselling (guess who will suggest and organise it!) But does anyone have any practical advice on how to address this, if you've been in the same position and something has helped? I know you can't change a person but you can work together at understanding each others needs. Please no 'he's a waste of space/LTB', I'd like to see if things can improve and help us both before it gets to that."
"How much divorce paperwork can I do myself?","Name changed, have had advice to LTB, am seeing sense and taking that advice. I’m seeing a solicitor for 30 mins free tomorrow. I don’t want to waste it and would like some help with what I should ask and how to word it. I’m thinking that now that there is no fault divorce, it’s cheaper for me to just fill in the application online myself rather than pay a solicitor to do that. Am I missing something? For context, H has refused to leave the family home (fair enough, we own it jointly) and has also refused to have any conversations about separating, finances etc. He says he won’t leave unless a judge tells him to and keeps repeating that he loves me, taking no responsibility for having been, to keep this short, a prize dick. What I’d like is a divorce that is quick and final, rather than the protracted drama I think STBXH would rather enjoy. What is the best way to word with with a solicitor to push things in that direction? I’m asking as I spoke to one last week. She was recommending mediation (which I am happy to do) but also recommending that her firm would be completing the divorce application. Am I missing an obvious reason why I shouldn’t be filling in what looks like a simple form? Is there a way of asking for help with financial and DC arrangements but doing the rest myself?"
"Break up at 40, childless","Hi all, just looking for some words of wisdom really or maybe just to write it all down…not sure really. Relationship of 8 months just ended at the weekend and I’m still in a bit of shock. Met a lovely man who I could see a future with and thought we were so happy. I’m absolutely devastated it’s over but more devastated for the reasons and wonder if I handled it badly. He has a dc (aged 4) from previous Ltr. I hadn’t met her and was conscious of not putting any pressure on him to do so, although I would very much have liked to. He shares 50/50 custody with his ex. I’ve always wanted a child and we’d spoken about it early on and while he wasn’t 100% committing to wanting another he also said he’d be open to it in the future and that he wouldn’t be with me if that’s not what he wanted. I raised it again at the weekend to check we were still on the same page and he said he absolutely wouldn’t want another. I was shocked and got a bit emotional and not sure if my reaction then ruined everything. We both cried quite a lot and I left that night so we could both have some space to think things over. He called me 2 days later and ended it saying it wouldn’t work and it would only be harder in the future if we were on such different pages. I don’t disagree with that but he was so cold and brutal when he ended it that I can’t get my head round us not discussing it more. He also told me that he’d not really had feelings for me which felt particularly cruel when i felt we’d got so close, met families, been on holiday, spent all his child free time with me. im now missing him desperately, so sad at the break up but also wondering if I’ve run out of time completely to find anyone and should have kept my mouth shut. Maybe my reaction that night made him lose all feelings for me. Over time he said he was planning on introducing me to his dc and I could have been part of that family and that he saw me in his long term future. sorry for the rant, I’m all over the place as you can probably tell!"
"DH seems to resent my bond with DC","Looking for some outside perspectives on this. Just as it says on the tin really, my husband is starting to seem like he really resents my bond with DC. Kids are 4 and 8 months. Oldest has always been quite clingy with me, will prefer me to do things for her or do bedtime etc. I don't feel it's anything out of the ordinary for a child her age really, and I know I always had a preference for mum when I was little so until recently it wasn't something I gave too much thought. Since DS has been born however, DH mentions this more frequently. He talks about the dynamic feeling like its us against him, like he's outside of our gang or something. There have been lots of little comments about it as if it's a dynamic I'm actively encouraging (I'm not but I also won't try to dampen <my> bond with them either). He is generally a loving and very involved Dad so I don't think that's the issue here, I think it's just a simple case of young kids wanting their mum. DD has never been a great sleeper and I've spent her whole life up and down most nights, putting her back to bed, comforting her, laying with her etc. This hasn't been practical since having the little one as I need to be available to him as a baby for night feeds, night time comforting etc. As a result DD has taken to cosleeping with us. She starts off in her own room, but invariably ends up climbing into our bed in the night. This isn't an issue for me but DH does not like it and has taken to sleeping in the spare room. He feels this only compounds the dynamic he thinks exists between us all. I'd prefer she sleeps in her own room but to be honest my main concern at this juncture is everyone getting a decent sleep It feels like its becoming quite a big issue for us as a family and for our marriage and I'm not sure how to handle it. I think his approach would be to be very tough on her about it but I don't want to do that as it feels wrong to me, and I also don't want her kicking off and waking the baby (we've tried it and she really does kick off) and to be honest, anything for some sleep. The sleeping arrangements are one thing, but his perception of the dynamic that exists between us is worrying to me. Anyone have any thoughts?"
"To be upset that DH’s relatives show zero interest","DH’s grandparents had 3 kids. MIL, DH’s aunt and his uncle. They lived in another English speaking country until a year or so after DH was born, when his grandparents moved everyone back to England. MIL had DH at 16 so extremely young and never really bothered and hence he was raised by grandparents almost in full. He’s now mid 20s and has no other family- no siblings and no cousins, as neither MIL, aunt or uncle have ever been in a LTR. Grandparents in their 70s and young for their age. They do live 2 hours away but we call and make a day trip of seeing them or meet in the middle at least twice a month. Uncle who lives 30 mins away is uninterested despite repeated efforts to get in contact to meet up from me and DH. MIL and his aunt have moved back to live overseas, and we very rarely hear from either. MIL is a complicated character, lies and has stolen from her parents and DH. She behaves like somebody much, much younger than us and is quite reckless and erratic. We are having DC soon and I feel really sad mainly for DH that nobody shows up for him except from his grandparents. DH has tried very hard to forge connections and plan get togethers but is often ignored entirely in group chats, and phone calls go unanswered. It was his birthday two weeks ago and nobody sent him a card or picked up the phone, his mum sent him a short text the day after. He has never met his dad so they are the only family he has. You have 365 days to remember a birthday, where’s the excuse? I know it gets him down and can’t even begin to understand as I (thankfully) come from a very loving and interested family who will call most days, often come round for cups of tea, go for walks together and such."
"Asking for help re mil/sil","Nc as quite outing. Mil is early 60s, sil early 30s. 3 years ago they jointly bought their council home together that they'd lived in for the previous 20 years. Sil was single at the time, mil was worried if anything happened to her and they were still renting that sil would end up homeless. Mil has since had a stroke and needs alot of adaptations to make the current home accessible. Sil has also since met her partner and is now pregnant due in December, her dp also has his ds 2/3 nights per week so come December there'll be 5 inc baby in the property. It's a 2 bed property and relatively small. Mil has applied to the local council for a bungalow but is getting nowhere due to being a homeowner. We've bid on flats within care home type settings too but again, getting nowhere. Now if they sold then there wouldn't be enough equity to buy anywhere else for sil as the property value was quite low when it was bought and hasn't increased much. She also wouldnt be approved for a mortgage on smp i'd imagine. Sil also took a high ltv to replace the kitchen etc at the time. Mil would also never get a mortgage so her share would just stop her benefits for a time until it was used up, but again she'd also be homeless. Or the council are saying she'd be making herself homeless. I don't think she'd pass the financial assessment for a private rental either. Mil needs new accommodation. She can't work, so receives universal credit of about 600, then we're waiting for her pip to be approved which will be another 700/800 we're hoping. Sil can't move out as rent prices are 2.2x her mortgage cost and she's going onto mat leave. I just can't figure out a way to get around this. Social services/ occupational therapy are more than happy to assess the current property but not to recommend rehousing. Council will not budge on the band allocation. We can't take mil off the mortgage or deeds because then it's intentional homelessness. Feels like times running out and we are getting nowhere. Any ideas gratefully received!"
"To pay off student loan?","I need some extremely boring advice and can’t seem to find an answer from Google. Im on plan 1 student loan in the U.K. and so I pay 9% on everything I earn over £22k a year. I am now into the higher rate tax bracket (just about) so I’m paying 29% on everything I earn under £50k and effectively 49% on everything above £50k. If interest rates had stayed low, I’d have paid my loan off last month but alas, the interest rate has gone from 0.9%-6% and I now have a further 18 months apparently until it’s paid off. I’m 33 and still career building so every pay rise and promotion is lessened and I’m just sick of seeing the thing on my payslip honestly! The thing is I’m the sole earner in my household (DH is a SAHP) and I was hoping to get the £340 this loan costs me per month back - our mortgage is going from 2% to 5% this month and that amount would just about cover the increase. I have an opportunity to clear the remaining balance with some savings, but if I do, will the full £340 return to my pay check or is the loan taken before tax? Meaning that £340 will be taxed and therefore will only return £170ish back to my pay packet? I’m trying to work out if it’s worth it or whether to just put the loan balance into the house to lower the LTV. I read online the loan if calculated at gross but taken from net so does that mean the full £340 will return?"
"95% LTV in todays buyers market","Finally got our deposit, but we’d be fools, right? It’s hundreds of pounds cheaper to stay renting and our rent is housing association so only goes up by a tiny percentage each year. We would only be able to afford something small not our forever home so would have to move at some point so we need to think about the chance of negative equity , stamp duty & all things like that"
"to go out for tea with my exH?","V quick background: split 8 years ago after 12 together. We have 2 DCs. No family where we live on either side so we've remained a solid unit where we share care 50/50, spend Xmas mornings together with partners for the kids, live close to each other and are generally still really good mates. Zero romantic feelings on either side any more. He's just come out of LTR and I'm very happily with my DP of 5 years. I spontaneously booked a restaurant for DP and I as they are doing a special menu. DP then reminded me that he is out that evening (he had told me, I'm just rubbish). I'd paid a deposit which was non-refundable and non-transferable to another night. Was going to take teen DD but the restaurant has a strict over 18s policy. No friends available at short notice. I've asked Ex and he's super keen as he loves the look of the menu. My DP absolutely fine with it. They get on well and occasionally text each other about bloke stuff 😂 We'll be driving, not drinking and kids will be at exes so we'll only be gone a few hours. It's come up in convo at work and a colleague has said they think it's really weird and they ""wouldn't let"" their DH go out for a meal with his ex. Is she the weirdo or are we?!"
"Helping an inept partner improve at housework","I know there have been lots of threads about inept partners (usually men) who rarely lift a finger to help with housework and the general response is often to question why you married them. However, can I ask if anyone has successfully found a way to improve this situation? My DH works hard and is good at his job, but when it comes to housework he is pretty useless. I have tried asking him, telling him, listing everything that needs done for him to choose from, stopping doing some things... He agrees to do more and things improve for a short while, but very quickly it reverts back to the norm again. Housework just isn't on his radar. It is never a priority for him, he doesn't notice when things need done, he doesn't mind if things are left not done. I do get resentful, but this is not a LTB situation. Is there any suggestion of practical ways to get him to help more without me having to nag him?"
"Leaving a perfectly happy LTR?","Partner is 28, in 26. Been in a very loving and happy relationship for 5 1/2 years. We rarely argue or fight and he is the most caring loving man I've ever been with. However, our sex life is a shambles and I no longer feel sexually attracted to him. We have had this issue for around 2/3 years now and have discussed it on multiple occasions. Things still haven't changed. It's me, not him FYI. I just feel I need to be on my own, but I'm scared to leave. We've built a lovely home together, got greats mutual friends and our family's fit perfectly. From an outsiders views, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. I just feel I've lost myself a bit, put on weight and feel I want my independence back. I want sex and I don't want it with him. It breaks my heart because he is the perfect man in every way. Hands on, helps around The house, does is share of chores. I do have to nudge him a lot to get things done as he can be lazy and forget to do things but overall. He's 10/10. Why am I not happy! He's attractive, lovely body etc. It's breaking me that I feel this way. I sat him down tonight and told him I'm not happy and feel I need to leave. Obviously he is devastated. Have I just got too comfortable? I don't understand my own mind. I'm scared the grass won't be greener and people keep telling me that. The last thing I want is another relationship after this. I just feel I need to be on my own. Any advice is welcome please"
"Lied about holiday - WWYD?","This is historic. But in the past I had shit boundaries and made some serious relationship mistakes. Would this have been instant LTB for you? Now - I think yes. I should have kicked him to the curb immediately. Of course, I put up with his crap for a lot longer. Here’s the situation. I gave birth to DC3 (our first together) We had a son. My ExH is from a culture where boys are a big deal. He had girls from his previous marriage. Our son was of course his first. Totally irrelevant to me but the context is important. I had awful PND (I’m Bipolar but this wasn’t known at the time so it was likely Bipolar depression too.) On meds. When our son was 3 months old, he took extended paternity leave. I went back to work. Told me he was going to teach language abroad to help poor and destitute people - a charity mission if you like. I was struggling, but encouraged him to go as out of self-sacrifice and and I felt guilty that he wanted to give up his time to help those who needed it more than me. This is obscene as I’m typing it. What a fool I was. He went. Whilst away, he emailed his sister but accidentally sent it to me. Saying ‘don’t tell me misses I’m in Dubai.’ I did some digging and found out he’d gone on a lads holiday to Dubai (not the country he’d told me he was going to) for a whole MONTH. After the month, he came back and said he couldn’t get a visa for the original war-torn destination so flew out to his mates instead. There was very little contact between us whilst he was away, as I didn’t want to interrupt his work and he said contact would be hard. We’d never had a holiday together. Aside from two days in a UK cottage that I had to pay for. And it bloody rained constantly. Fucking liar. This should have been a deal breaker right? I can’t actually remember how I reacted when he came back. As I was pretty ill at the time, I think I just stayed quiet. 12 years on, we’re divorced and I’m still raging."
"AIBU to think this type of communication is condescending?","I know this person from a group of friends. I met with her for coffee/lunch a few times one-to-one and she seemed very reasonable, even sweet. But when we are in a group dynamic, her tone changes drastically towards me. She questions the legitimacy of what I tell for no apparent reason or try to make fun of what I say. In these cases, I usually respond in a decent, calm manner dismissing her behavior. As an example, couple of weeks ago, she sent a link from a newspaper in a group chat. It was about some subject that I brought up when we met with the group. In the msg, she wrote ""<myname>, read this and summarize for us. I found it too long to read."" The newspaper link is behind a paywall and I'm not subscribed so I respond back if she can copy-paste and send the article I'll be interested to read. Now, I'm still thinking if her style is really condescending or not? If yes, how to handle such condescending communication? I can cut her out of my life, no problem, I don't think I'll miss her at all but I wonder in general, if I'm at a spot to experience such communication style, what is the best way to deal right away? If my style gives the other person the encouragement that I can be a doormat, I want to change that."
"Judith Butler explains gender!","At last, gang! It's the answers we've all been asking for! <sits down with large cup of tea>"
"Husband badmouthing me","Just popped to the shop to get some bits for tea. Got home just in time to hear my husband saying ‘Mummy is useless’ to our small children - as he couldn’t find some leggings for your youngest - I haven’t put some washing away from a few days ago and they were all in the washing basket rather than her room. Needless to say, as a Mum, I do the vast majority of bloody everything. I was up at 5 with our youngest today and had done all the chores before he and our eldest had woken up. I immediately said he should not be badmouthing me in front of our children and that he had a bloody nerve. Urgh. Really dislike men in general today. LTB? Dip his toothbrush down the toilet? Suggestions please."
"AIBU to feel upset or is DH a baddun?","NC as have posted lots re DH. I find it hard to get perspective as perimeno and currently mid mood dip. Feeling really sad and a bit pissed off. DH and I had a massive argument last week. I was asking him to change one very problematic behaviour (if it doesn’t change its LTB territory - giving it 6 months). He was feeling ashamed (he admitted later) so was then hurling everything he could at me verbally - blamed me for everything wrong in his life. I was angry with him and did express myself crossly, but stick to the one thing. I don’t want to go into specifics but after he’d finally broken down, said sorry and said he’d get counselling to figure out why he does it, he also said that the things he’d hurled at me in the argument weren’t things I really was to blame for. He’d just been in defensive mode. Since then he has made an effort to retain closeness and change the problem behaviour but has slipped up a couple of times with DC to a lesser extent. Got cross and shouted (nothing too bad in any other context but not OK) I’ve still been feeling a bit guarded with him and was pissed off about the slip ups and we have planned to talk again tomorrow. I’ve been subdued and a bit snippy with him to be honest. In the meantime, mostly, I’ve been working so unavailable. No time alone together. He then went out all last night til late then gave me this choice today; if I’m going to still feel angry with him he won’t spend time with me tonight and he’s going to go out with a friend. if I’m in a better mood and ok, if I want to spend time with him he will stay in with me. I felt stuck. Firstly I don’t know how I’ll feel. Secondly in the big argument one of the things he blamed me for was him not seeing friends (it’s not true, I pushed him, in fact, to see friends more as it’s good for his well-being). He later admitted it wasn’t the case but I’m still reticent to express an opinion. I said it was up to him. I explained that I’m reticent to express an opinion because of the above. I actually thought we should try and spend some quality time together but didn’t feel able to say. I feel really sad that he’s now gone out, I’ve no idea where or how long he’s out for. I feel like, given the big argument and his problematic behaviour, he should be making more of an effort. He should be going the extra mile to help me to feel more secure and loved. Instead he’s pissed off out with his mate. Am I being over emotional and unreasonable to feel aggrieved by this or do I need to give my head a wobble?"
"To ask how on earth they are meant to do it?","Inspired by some threads on here, I really feel for single people who are also on low wages with maybe other issues going on which may impact on work etc. The COL is so high now that if you don't have a partner or a wealthy family, then it is incredibly hard to make your own way especially if you live and work in an expensive area. I read so many threads where the OP is told to just move out or LTB but in reality and in these times, that is clearly much easier said than done. If I hadn't of met DH, I wouldn't have been able to afford to live alone in London and to move away would have meant leaving my job, friends and family. I feel sorry for people trying to make their way now and wish it was easier. In many ways I feel we are going backwards in this country."
"Unbelievable sexual desire","Happily in a LTR but the sex isn't there anymore. I've got this crushing urge to touch, smell, kiss any man I am attracted too. I just want to clarify I would NEVER cheat. I've never had an urge this bad before. Can anyone please give me some advise to tone down my libido, it's the highest it's been in years. FYI I've mastered 5 times today.."
"I am upset that my sister rolled me up in a carpet and kicked me to death","Sorry, I couldn't resist <gets coat>"
"Lack of sex getting me down","LTR with a baby, we’re always tired, DP works long hours so we get very little chance to DTD. We go to bed at different times as I’m up with baby, weekends are rushed with shopping and visiting family. We literally never stop. We haven’t had sex in so long I’m sure my vagina has resealed itself by now. Im always initiating and trying to plan ahead when we do it but something changes or he’ll go to bed early and it never happens. When we did attempt it baby woke up so we didn’t get a chance. I know this is normal with a baby but it’s become an excuse now. Baby sleeps all night and naps in the day, we do get chances but DP isn’t interested and would rather play on the ps5 or sleep. I feel like it’s affecting our relationship because without sex it’s not really a relationship, there’s no intimacy and I’m beginning to feel resentful. He can take or leave it where I’d happily do it daily. I’ve now let insecurities in my head that he’s porn obsessed or cheating because why else would a man turn down the opportunity of sex. We’ve spoken about it and he promised to make the effort but that was 2 weeks ago. I don’t want to wait months in between each session and expected to be grateful for it. I’m sick of using toys when I have a partner who should be part of the act. Did anyone else go through this and how did you get your sex life back, if ever?"
"I'm just so sick and tired of the hypocrisy and lack of thinking","Forgive me, I just need a small rant. I was listening to Radio 1 in the car earlier and the news came on - top news story was about Nicola Sturgeon and how only one person slated to take over from her would pursue the Gender Reform bill. They interviewed a non-binary individual - and as an aside, would you believe, I think that young enby was actually female?! - anyway. They interviewed a few people who were all chagrined that the bill didn't pass, and one young woman who said she no she wouldn't ever vote in favour of a similar bill, as it's far wider reaching as it has impacts on sports, women's quotas, safety etc. They then go back to the aforementioned enby who says ""well that's not happening is it? This bill doesn't erode women's rights, it just gives people like me rights we don't have"". <eyeroll> Of course, I appreciate they only have limited time and there's an obvious bias - but the second piece of news was about child runaways who were placed in adult homes which a) goes against safeguarding rules, and b) is literally dangerous! If I had been alone I would have been screaming at the radio this is the exact point of the previous piece of news! Later on, I'm scrolling through Tiktok. I follow this woman who does the whole ""takedown of the men"" schtick. Liked her a lot until today. Someone asked her about TERFS, and she does a vid about how she thinks it's because they're either scared of trans women because they're all straight men trying to get into women's spaces - in reality trans women are FOUR TIMES more likely to be attacked than anyone else. Second reason is because they see trans women taking something away from them, and that feminists reduce 'women' to bodily functions. Third reason I can't remember but I know she ended on TERFs being white cisgender women and that gender expression isn't the same as sex. I commented that being a woman literally means being an adult human female, and that she clearly has no understanding of radical feminism or feminism of any kind....and she thought that was hilarious. I'm tempted to respond but I know I'll get angry and she'll use it as fodder so I've just unfollowed. But I'm still mulling it over because it made me so cross. Everything boils down to - I'm telling you what to think and feel and that's ok, but if you do that to me I'll get all sad and possibly hurt myself because you're the big bad meany . Ugh. Sorry that is LONG and boring but I needed somewhere to vent and I don't have a diary! Thanks if you bothered reading :)"
"DH refusing to have therapy or even talk about it","Dh has always had a bad temper, his outbursts are upsetting and scary - typically they involve things to do with driving (hsi big trigger) when - if - say we miss a turning at a roundabout he completely loses the plot. It's toxic to be around for me and dc and impacts him in he has severe neck pain, which leaves him bedridden twice a month or so. This is clearly psychosomatic - every physical cause has been ruled out. If we tell him he needs help (and dc1 and I do frequently) he loses it and says we just blame him for everything. He was carted off to boarding school at a ridiculously young age, which he admits affected him terribly, his father (and gf too) apparently also had a terrible temper when younger but this is seen in the family as 'But now dad's mellowed.' Not good enough. Dc1 has just gone to uni. DC2 is 16 and basically having a nervous breakdown, I'm seeking help for her. She is the one most affected by her father's moods. I have been saying to dh for years he needs anger management or therapy, he agrees but never does anything about it. He and I are very stressed about dc2 right now and he has frequent outbursts - he's trying not to have them in front of her but he does, and when he gets angry with me it's horrible. For example, today I heard some disturbing news relating to dc2 went to tell him (he's wfh) only to get snarled at that I'd interrupted him when he was paying a bill online and now he'd have to get the OTP again. A normal person would say, oh no now I've missed the OTP, sorry can I just do this and you will have all my attention Told dh he needs help, dh loses it and - as ever - starts shouting again about why do we blame him. I left the house. I have texted him the numbers of a couple of therapists I've recommended. He says he's too busy to think about it. I'm home now and he came and asked if we were friends. I said only if he had therapy and he stormed off again. Basically, I would like to ltb but can't when dc2's mental health is already so unstable. He's working outside, I have texted him saying I will come with him to therapy or have it myself but he has to address this. I feel I am going to be stuck under the same roof as him literally not talking to him for years until dc2's very complex mh needs are sorted out. Therapy would help him hugely."
"When did you know to leave","I know the answer but just needed to vent as don't have anyone in RL I can talk to. ""DP"" is a selfish alcoholic. His priorities only seem to be going out every weekend, until early hours although he didn't come back home last night. I'm 7 months pregnant with our first baby, in temp rental accommodation but he is buying a house which he has said whatever happens me and baby are welcome to stay. I have completed housing association application but can take up to 5 months for this to be processed so feel a bit trapped. He can be nasty once he's been drinking and then the hangover lasts at least until mid week so whilst he's ""recovering"" from the weekend his temper varies. He says he loves me, will shower me with affection maybe one day a week where everything seems great but then he says we can't be together as it's my fault: I didn't treat him well when I first met him and we were both single as I didn't know what I wanted (had come out of an abusive LTR) and my fault completely, liked being single and finally being free. He apparently ""knew straight away"" I was the one and makes me feel guilty I didn't feel like that. I don't really know what I'm asking for, advice, reassurance or just kind words. The baby is not at all a mistake and I cannot wait for them to arrive, I just feel ashamed bringing them into the world in this messy situation."
"Fireworks after friendship?","Met a fab guy, X, online Aug 20. Early 50s. Had a few dates. Really clicked, but due to COVID, he didn't want to meet up IRL. We carried on messaging and became really good friends, even supporting each other through some tough life situations. Life carried on for both of us. We met IRL once in Aug 21 when X felt COVID was low enough. Again, that spark was there. We were both in a position to properly start dating in Dec 22. X lives 2 hours away, so seeing each other is limited. We've probably spent about 25 days together since Dec. This week, X told me he doesn't feel anything different for me compared to December. He said there's no fireworks. So he can't see a long term outlook for us. Because he wants the fireworks and flutters and those infatuation feelings you get early on when you meet someone. From my perspective, my other 2 LTRs began as friendships, so there wasn't the fireworks he's describing. The love grew from knowing the person deeply, rather than the heady rush. Which is where I was heading with him... He's never had a friendship become a relationship. So I don't think he can get his head around that love doesn't need the fireworks. Plus, I think he probably had the fireworks back when we met due to his behaviour but he suppressed them as he knew it wouldn't go anywhere. So much has happened since Aug 20, he can't recall his emotions from that time. I certainly had a buzz when we met and was so disappointed when keeping COVID safe was his priority, although fully respected his decision. We're going to have a follow up chat soon after we've processed all that we talked about. I think we need to spend more time together before he concludes love between us is unlikely to grow. For me, having a friend turn into a partner is the very best outcome. For X, it's a non starter because he's not having that emotional high. Has anyone experienced fireworks with a friend turned partner? Have I got it all wrong and should I have expected fireworks about my friend when we started dating?"
"Feeld","Experiences of Feeld please? I know it's known for being sex focussed (which is not a bad thing), but where does it fit on the FWB, ONS, LTR spectrum? What do Feeld dates feel like compared to Bumble or OKC or Match?"
"Is this flirting? I'm so out of touch","Until recently, I was in a very long-term relationship which meant I lost the art of flirting and/or detecting flirting, both of which I used to be absolutely world-class at. I go to a fitness class. It's a small class - 5 women plus instructor - so we know each other quite well. The instructor is always very complimentary to me. But that's because I work really hard, I've made really good progress and there's a running joke that my life's a mess (its not really) so kind words are welcome! A few weeks ago at the pub, one of the women made an off-hand comment about my stonewalling the instructor's flirting. It was part of a different conversation so I didn't ask what she meant. I'd never thought the instructor was flirting before. It hadn't even occurred to me. Last week, I spotted in the mirror the same woman and another woman exchange a kind of 'knowing' look between them as the instructor helped me with weights. I didn't think too much of it. Last night, we were all joking about body goals. I said something like ""I'm quite happy. If I could just get my abs to pop. And tone my arms. And lose my fat arse. And get rid of my squishy hips. So not happy at all then, LOL"". The instructor replied ""No, you're perfect"". Until that point, we'd all been joking. His tone wasn't very jokey. It went quiet and was a bit awkward. I'm now wondering if the instructor has actually been flirting with me for a while and I just haven't noticed because I'm so out of practice. Would you interpret this as flirting? I guess you can't know without being there, sorry. I'm a bit scrambled. I was in an LTR for ages and only recently started to get my head around being single and all that entails."
"David Greig - playwright - struggle session","https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/23728722.playwright-david-greig-apologises-row-tweets/ 'ONE of Scotland’s most high-profile playwrights has apologised to staff at the Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh for “careless and harmful” Twitter actions. David Greig’s apology came after another writer accused him of favouriting tweets she alleged were transphobic.

Rosie Aspinall Priest, an artist and researcher, shared the two liked tweets, alleging that Mr Greig was “openly liking transphobic tweets.” “Really awful things on display here that do not align with the values inherent within Scotland’s theatre sector,” she said.

"AIBU to try to hide my pregnancy until after close family wedding?","My brother and (new!) sister in law are getting married in around 8 weeks time. I'm one of her bridesmaids, and am attending / organising a hen do in Newcastle in a couple of weeks time and also a long 'hen weekend' in Marbella in a few weeks. I've just had a very faint - but visible! - blue positive line on an early pregnancy test, so think I am about 4 weeks pregnant. I love my brother and his bride to bits, and do not in any way want to steal their thunder or detract from their wedding and celebrations!! WIBU to not tell anyone about my pregnancy until a few weeks after their wedding? And if so, how do I manage that while also not drinking at the hen events and also the wedding itself, and also with my dress / alterations?! Or is it better to tell just a few select people (parents, bro and sis in law) as early as possible to try to get the surprise out of the way a few weeks before the wedding, and so they don't question my alcohol intake? What I don't want is to increase distraction by causing speculation. It's definitely a surprise pregnancy, so won't be expected by anyone (as it wasn't expected by me!!) And obviously not ideal timing. Though I am of course delighted to be having another baby <3"
"Already LTB but want closure","Been together 20 months. Was BF’s birthday. Said he would let me know if he was doing anything after he had seen his kids, but he was tired and didn’t feel like partying. I don’t drive so I need him to pick me up - he lives 15 minutes away. Didn’t get any messages, felt like an idiot. So I wrote “hey, what’s happening?” He read it at 21:30 but no answer. We spoke the next morning and he said he had fallen asleep. Arranged to meet later but his car broke down. He was going out for a school reunion that evening. so we agreed to meet the next evening. He said we would have a cosy evening together. He picked me up, nothing seemed wrong. Went back to his, everything was lovely. Then a female neighbour 20 years younger than him came over. Started talking about the evening on his birthday. He said he hadn’t planned anything and people just turned up (everyone goes in and out of each other’s houses in his village) so he couldn’t get out to get me. I was willing to accept that but not that he didn’t message me as I might have been able to find another way there. I had to stay the night as I had no transport. He turns me on a lot and I stupidly had sex and it was loving as always. l was crying in the morning. We talked a bit. The neighbour had stayed for a bit with some other people for our cosy evening. He was hugging me and kissing me in front of everyone. Then she talked about her dog walk with him that afternoon. Stuff they had done in the evening together the week before. Seemed he had been spending time with the neighbour a few days later, I get a message from a mutual friend asking me why I wasn’t there. That he had a huge bbq and they all had a great time. he won’t tell me why he lied and why he didn’t want me there. I’m feeling pretty. All I got was “sorry, I didn’t mean to lie to you” by text message. Haven’t heard anything else at all."
"Debit Finance Ltd setting up direct debit without my authorisation","Surely this cannot be right. I have had no correspondence from this company and I did not set this direct debit up. A quick google tells me they deal with incorrectly cancelled gym memberships and similar. To the best of my knowledge I have never had a gym membership as I can’t afford them. I will call my bank this morning but wanted to warn people that it seems this company can just reach in to your bank about t and remove money without any prior correspondence and without your agreement or permission. they have taken £30 which doesn’t sound like a lot but to us it’s food on the table because money is very very tight right now. ….to the extent I have taken on a second job.

"To ask why it’s so hard to claim UC?","I’ve had a migration letter telling me I have to apply for UC (currently on Tax Credits). I work full time but was previously self-employed and the Ltd company still exists (it’s dormant) so I declared that on the form but said I don’t get any income from it. I’ve now been told I have to attend a ‘self-employment’ appointment at the Job Centre to discuss how I am gainfully self-employed. I am not! I’ve tried to tell them this but the only way of communicating is via the online ‘journal’ and they take a week to reply and don’t answer my questions anyway. They keep setting appointments at a Job Centre an hour away (not my local one as apparently it is temporarily closed) but I can’t make any of them as I work full time. Am I supposed to take unpaid leave to attend? I just want to speak to someone on the phone about it, but every number I call says they can’t answer questions about UC. I’m at a total loss. Any advice?"
"Friend wondering what to do","NC for this. My friend had to wade through a lot of toads on OLD before finally finding a bloke that she fancies and who is jovial and good to her; she has a lot of good to say about him. However, the downside is that she thinks he's alcoholic (or at the very least, a ""problem drinker""). He can drink at least 2 litres of vodka PLUS other drinks over the weekend when they're together. Of course he claims that he never has a hangover etc. Also of course that he could ""stop any time"" (yeah) and that he doesn't drink during the week because of work (she doesn't see him then to know if this is true but surely that amount of vodka in a night would kill someone who's not a regular drinker?) For context, she's retired, he's a bit younger so not yet retired. Neither of them has children. They don't live together and whilst he wants to, she doesn't. He drives (I know, I know). She likes a glass of wine or two with her dinner but is not a heavy drinker. She often talks about this and it clearly bugs her. Naturally it worries her, but also is causing a bit of friction, eg he's not got spare cash to go on holiday because it's all been spent on booze. She's torn between just having a good time with him, as she enjoys his company and fancies him, and it's not as though they are younger and wanting to plan a family or buy a house together. Or is this a LTB issue, but she's had enough of kissing frogs and doesn't fancy starting again! She also knows that only he can sort out his drinking, and only if he chooses to do -- it's not in her power. She asks me my opinion and as a good friend I feel it's my job to let her vent and question, but not my job to tell her what to do. My own views are also coloured by unhappy memories of my ex's alcoholism which was one of the things that killed my marriage. So, although it's not my problem, I just wondered what the wider world's view would be on this. YABU - he gets on top of his drinking, or else it's LBT time YANBU - no kids, no financial ties, just live in the moment. (there's no real logic to those categories but I had to divvy it up somehow!) (Reiterating - I'm not going to tell her what to do. I'm just wondering how other people see this sort of situation)."
"Husband often gets me confused with his Ex Girlfriend","For background: been with DH for 13 years, married 10. Have 2 DC. Have the usual ups and downs that most married couples have. The issue: many times over the years my DH has recalled certain memories of ""the time we did....."" or ""remember when we went to XYZ restaurant with Bob and Jean"" etc etc. Tonight's was ""tell you what we haven't had for ages... grilled aubergine! We used to have that all the time!"" Dear good people of Mumsnet... we have NEVER had grilled aubergine. I fecking HATE aubergine. These memories he's having are all about him and his ex. He was with her for 10 years and split up from her 2 years before we met. They are still very good friends and I have no issue with that- in fact I would also now class her as a friend; she came to our wedding and our kids call her ""Auntie XXX"". She's lovely and I care a lot about her. Whenever he has these recollections, I always say ""that wasn't with me, dear ... that was with XXX"". He'll insist it was with me until I point out that I hate aubergines (a fact he well knows) and have never met Bob and Jean. I always roll my eyes but generally take it in good part and don't really get offended. He can be quite scatty and forgetful so I just put it down to that. He certainly doesn't harbour any feelings towards her or anything. Tonight I pulled his leg about it again and said something along the lines of ""most wives probably wouldn't be as easy going about this as I am"".... which I think is probably true (is it?). But he just thinks it's no big deal and even said something like ""I have had a life before you, you know!"" Now I will admit that his last comment really pissed me off. I KNOW he's had a life before me... i've embraced having his ex in our lives, am cool with it, like her very much and care about her. I TOO have had a life before him.... but I dont ever remind him of the time we ""used to play cards in the pub"" or ""remember when we went to the boxing with Dave and Sarah!"" Ie. Things I did with my ex. And if I did ever do this, I'd be mortified. So what do you think? Would most wives be ok with these occasional mixed up memories? Or should I LTB? Semi light-hearted.... it generally doesn't bother me and tonight's example didn't until the point where he made it seem like I was being unreasonable for even calling him out on it, which I did in a light hearted way."
"How do I react to this projection. I hate confrontation.","dh and I woke this morning and ended up rowing over something stupid. He literally lost it with me. (It was over something he hadn’t done. I was fine with it but he kicked off, probs through guilt and embarrassment). he stormed off to work and that was that. However he has ghosted me for the day. Normally that’s fine if we don’t speak or text as we both are really busy. But today with the storm, I’d have expected him to keep in touch as he was in driving in 90mph winds. Instead he went silent on me. he came home from work and hasn’t said a word. Stone walled me. I’ve left him to it so it didn’t empower him. To make it worse, tonight he became vile. I caught him being really horrid to my dog, talking like crap and then pushed her. So I pulled him up on it. Told him that he was being out of order. He flipped. Really verbally abusive. I think because he was caught out. my kids were in ear shot so I told him to stop. He walked into my bedroom where I was and smiled, clapped, then put the v’s up to me. now I know this sounds pathetic. But it was the cold calm visual figure in front of me that’s upset me. Words can fly but this was meant. I got upset to which he told me i was a schizophrenic. He said one minute I’m ok then next upset. This hurt. ive not said a word since. We are both in bed and he’s now snoring next to me. im just left feeling horrid. All of this because he forgot to do something and is projecting onto me. Please don’t say ltb. But what can I do and how should I react tomorrow when we wake up??"
"To find it really bloody annoying..","That Mumsnet at the moment seems to be troll post after troll post? I just don't get it and sometimes they don't even seem like troll posts (which I suppose is the point) but five times this week I've commented offering well thought out advice (as well as other users) on quite serious issues only to go back to the thread for it to have the dreaded deletion message ""this is a troll"", ""this is a banned user"" etc and it's just feels a bit infuriating. I love Mumsnet and find it a really supportive place and dare I say sometimes fun place to be but at the moment It just seems every other thread is being deleted as a troll post and I know mnhq can't really do more than they already are and they try and blast them asap but lt just seems to be everywhere atm. Also going off track a little bit but I also think MN usernames should have banned trigger words as the other night a lot of posts were being commented on by usernames relating to SA and SA against children but that's another issue. Is it just the case now of taking the risk of commenting and just hoping the poster is genuine? I know this is a non issue really in the grand scheme of things but I just wanted have a collective MN moan because surely other users are finding it a bit annoying too?"
"think she likes me, she's just started dating another guy, wanna disclose: irl or text?","hey mumsnet :) thought u might be able to help me... any advice really appreciated <3 situation: UK m32 f25 we work together (I know I know) for a year and a bit. honestly always liked her, I was in a ltr until around 6 months ago, thought about making a move since but wanted to give myself space to heal etc. also didn't want it to be a rebound thing - she's very very lovely. still don't quite know if she likes me back, hard to read but definitely some positive signs. she wasn't really involved with anyone for most of the time I've known her but now she's gone on a couple of dates with another boy... I feel very strongly about this girl, I increasingly want to just say like, this is how I feel, if you are interested let me know. regardless of whether this is a good idea or not (though any advice on that is appreciated lol) my question is... should this statement be made in real life, or as a message? I feel like in real life could be putting pressure on her to respond (also terrifying), but then a message is like a cop out? / would make it super awkward next time we see each other. hindered by: work together - don't wanna make work awkward for her. friends - don't wanna explode friendship (also friendship group at work). age gap - super wary of pushing anything at all cos creep factor. motivation for disclosure: think we could be really great together, this other guy sounds ok but yknow, so thinking I should say before it's too late / they end up a proper couple... any advice (particularly from mid twenties women) super appreciated ty ty"
"Hand hold - petrified to be single and alone","End it with DP of 6 and half years. This will be the first time living on my own and being financially burdened without any help. I'm petrified I'm going to become lonely and the nights will pull me into a dark depression of some sort. I've never lived on my own, albeit I've always been independent prior to my LTR. Advise on how to live happily on your own whilst going through a separation. Thank you"
"Commitment phobe it seems...??","Hi Met a guy online looking for a LTR, settle down. 5 months of dating and we got on so well together. He treated me like we were in a relationship (ie exclusive, lovely messages each day, met regularly). Red flags-5 months on didn't want to label things ""labels create expectations"" Never opened up emotionally eg wouldn't declare his love Preferred to take things slow I got fed up with it so ended things, saying what a nice guy he is and how he'll find someone with the same outlook. Haven't spoken in weeks. I'm confused. I know his ex suddenly left him just before getting a house together. Has this damaged him? Commitment phobic or...you tell me. He still likes my posts on insta and views my stories. Thing is I dated 16 guys and he is the one who i felt a strong connection with . I really miss him but I shouldn't have to beg for a relationship. I am on dating sites (again lol)"
"It's easy to tell someone they should LTB, but what when its not even possible?","Without getting into any of the many reasons, my 25 year marriage is dead. I can't take it any more. I want out. But we live in a place with a terrible housing crisis. We have three children, one with SN. We live in Social Housing rental. There's nowhere for him to go, there's nowhere for me to go. We both earn reasonable money, but not close to enough to rent another property, on the open market, even if there were anything available, which there is not. I have no family in this country, his elderly parents are three hours away. He can't go there and keep his job and see his children, and they wouldn't want him anyway, he's 51 years old. If I tried to rent, even if there were any houses, it would cost everything I earn in a month just on rent. It's not possible If we were together, we can have a nice home and provide for our children and look after them properly and have enough money for holidays and birthday presents etc. But apart, we'd both be penniless, even if we could find somewhere for him or me to live, which we can't. What am I supposed to do? Live like this forever, trapped and unable to choose? It's bad enough that my marriage is dead, I'm heartsick over it, but this limbo is even worse. AIBU to think that sometimes there are no options? Sometimes you can't just LTB, or have him leave you?"
"Struggling with dating after a LTR","Hi All, I was in a relationship for 6 years. He left early 2022 after dumping me. At the start of 2023 I had healed a great deal- new friends, greater social life, no longer struggling to come home to an empty house, focused on me etc. I have dated quite a few guys- some just after sex, some not feeling a connection etc. I recently met a lovely guy. We have met 8 times and text each day. He seems very into me. However, after 8 dates, I'm not sure if I love him. I still think about the ex. I always will care for him I guess (my first relationship). I realise he isn't coming back. My date stayed with me last night. We are dating exclusively but I felt guilty having him in the home. After 8 dates I guess I don't really know him. He is planning future dates already and makes lots of compliments. Any advice? Have you been in a similar situation? Diffuculty moving on..."
"Guilt over the partner gossiping","I’ve caused an awkward situation and I feel immense guilt for it. I had some issues with my partner recently where I felt very depressed as a result and only had one person to confide in. I told her a lot of personal stuff mid rant and felt a lot better for offloading. She was supportive and gave good advice, so when I feel down I know I can go to her as she does with me about her partner often too. She has now began using offensive names towards my partner and clearly doesn’t like him or respect him based on what I have said. She is nice in front of him and they get on well, but clearly my ranting has changed her perception of him. To add none of it was bad, just silly things that rub me up the wrong way and nothing for me to LTB over like abuse etc. I now feel so awful that she sees my partner like this and calls him names. I don’t know how to tell her to stop without contradicting myself as it was my fault I ranted to her about private stuff to begin with and now she is using it against him. My partner is unaware that she does this or that she even knows private things about him or our relationship. He’s a lovely sweet man who wouldn’t hurt a fly and I feel awful every time I look at him that his private business is now out there because of me being angry. He’ll be so hurt if he knew I told anyone or kept my true feelings to myself all this time. If I confess then it will cause a huge divide and make things much more awkward when we’re all together, which is very often as we’re a close family. I take full responsibility for what I’ve done and that I can’t take it back, but I don’t know how to proceed from here. I just had a message where she is calling him a dumb f*ck for putting the cutlery in the wrong drawer when she visited last night. Completely uncalled for and gone too far from our typical male rants we began with. I’ve never spoken about her partner in a derogatory way, even though he doesn’t work and spends all day on his PlayStation living with her rent free, which she complains about daily, I’m still polite about him and wouldn’t dare judge or name call. What do I do?"
"Tw@ts that stop in the middle of the road...","....to let their umpteen kids out for school when there's a specific drop off point right there! Ok so you stop. No hazards or anything to suggest what you're doing. One gets out, two, then three. Close the door. Open the fucking door for a chin wag. Shut the door, walk off and then walk fucking back as you've forgotten some shit. Don't you know that getting to work 25 seconds quicker makes all the fucking difference. Grrr <Roy Kent> AIBU?"
"To ask for some help with making friends","This feels a bit cringe to do this but frankly I need some help! Short version - didn’t learn the skills for making friends in dysfunctional childhood, have some long distance LT ones, great DP, want to make local friends after being in situ for 10 years+ and not sure how to. All advice very welcome! Longer version is that after a difficult childhood not conducive to learning the skills needed for making/keeping friends school’friends’ in hindsight - and after therapy - were just replicas of dysfunctional patterns and weren’t positive for me or my self esteem and led to risky behaviour in a desire for connection. Made a couple of good uni friends that I still see now but not so often as we are all scattered. Lovely people who tbh I kind of latched onto and have stayed the distance. Very lucky to have a lovely long term DP. They are an introvert like me and get all the socialising they need/want through the sport they play and are happy with the 2 of us but will be supportive of doing something with others if I get to that stage. Therapy has helped me hugely look back and process the dysfunction. What I’m looking for now is strategies to make and keep some friends please after being in this area for 10+ years plus and not having anyone local to do coffee with or films etc. Ideally would like to find my ‘tribe’ but living in a place that doesn’t fit with my political view, not being religious or sporty is reducing options to meet people and I’d rather not pretend to like stuff I don’t. Am planning to join a couple of other clubs though and hope to get some strategies/tips from people who are more effective in this area! Thank you in advance."
"*Trigger warning* Was this sexual coercion? Does coercion invalidate consent?","Morning all, I've been thinking recently about two instances I had with my now XH, and would like other women's opinions on whether this was sexual coercion? Both involving weekend trips away. The first time, I had just got out the shower that morning and he kept asking and asking for sex, I said no I didn't want to. For background, our sex life dwindled years prior to this. He kept on. Saying what was the point in booking to go away (paid for by me FYI) if we weren't going to have sex blah blah blah. I thought to myself, if we don't have sex he's going to be in a bad mood and refuse to do any of the things we planned and there would just be an atmosphere. I relented. He had sex with me. As soon as he finished, I immediately went back into the shower again and just cried. He moaned about me going back in the shower again saying it made him feel like shit. Second time, another weekend away. Same story, asked for sex, but this time he made it clear that he would be in a bad mood and would deliberately ruin our time there if we didn't do it. I relented again, and this time I actually cried during it. He didn't care and kept going. So, aside from being an absolute creep who is able to have sex with, and be aroused enough by a crying woman to finish, was this also sexual coercion? It took me another year but fortunately I did eventually LTB."
"Go to the party or not?","My old friend's bday party is tomorrow. He's a really old friend from childhood and I adore him. He's throwing a big party in London. I am not feeling very well, (feels like a bad head cold and nausea), but I think it may be related to allergies rather than a virus... I really want to go to the party 😩. I know it will be a good party. I also want to see my lovely old friend on his big bday. It involves a train into London (an hour away) and then staying overnight with another friend. I am thinking I might play it by ear and see if I can make it, but I don't want to let either friend down at the last minute? But at the same time if I cancel now and then start to feel better, I'll feel silly. Also if I go and am ill, I'll have infected a trainful of people, plus the friend im staying with plus the people at the party, plus I'll be stuck in London and will have to get the train back home (I need to be home by lunchtime so dh can go out on the Saturday- we have small dcs) I was so looking forward to a nice night out and now don't know if I can go <pouts> YABU - stay at home, cancel now YANBU - play it by ear and only cancel if you get worse"
"Husband not speaking","(Apart from the obvious LTB. Which I know and making plans for) How can I deal with him. He stopped talking to me 2 weeks ago. Nothing major at all happened he has these mood swings a lot, he’s very much like his mother they both are the same. Over past 2 weeks I’ve had my daughters party which he didn’t turn up for and I had to drag my 3 kids on my own to the venue and put up balloons etc whilst they cried, it was so stressful. He turned up at the end and my friend mentioned he looked really out of it (no drugs at all he’s never taken them but he seemed drunk). When I was sitting with parents (child started reception so hardly know them) he sat with us with crying red eyes! So embarrassing. I got my BIL to take him over to my other BIL. my daughter had her sports day and again he didn’t turn up but just as we were leaving he turned up. He started walking away and I called him and he sat in the car but he was breathing really loudly and told me he’s not sitting in the car with me and walked off. over Xmas when visiting my parents he tried “running away” a few times, my sister reminded me he did the same thing of trying to get in the car and running away when my daughter was born 8 years ago, I ordered papa johns pizza and he kept saying “these bastsreds have probably never had pappardelle johns in their lives”. its not just my family he’s like this whether they are there or not, I hate him, this morning I tried to be civil and he just started again. Advice please. my sons graduation from nursery is coming up and a few more events. Shall I just not tell him or tell him and risk him embarrassing me."
"Is it me, or is it my relationship?","As a back story my mum was EA and narcissistic and my exH very similar, so I haven't had a great relationship history. I've been with my partner for 5 years. It turns out he wasn't actually single when we met, I was OW for 3 months with absolutely no knowledge of this other person (it was a long distance relationship and he says he didn't see her at all during this time). He also slept with someone else right at the time we started seeing each other. None of this stuff became apparent until about a year into our relationship, when he initially lied about it and then told the truth (well, it could be the truth or not, I don't know, but he admitted to both of the things above). We split up for a while and then got back together - I think both of us had shitty relationships before and I felt that this one was better (yes, I know...!) and we had something between us worth saving. Fast forward a few years, and things aren't great. He is working a lot of hours, which is exactly what my ex used to do, and it triggers me back to that past relationship. Maybe it's not entirely fair of me to feel that way, he has to work after all, but I sometimes just feel tired of the fact that it's often just me, holding all of the responsibilities of our life and household (I have 2 children with exH) and he is not part of it. He pays half the bills, but other than that lives here rent free (I've posted about this before and I know it's not on) and financially benefits from the situation as his house is rented out whilst he lives here. He does, however, pay for weekends away and meals out etc as I can't currently afford them - he earns at least 5x more than me. However, I've had a really shit time since covid, and I don't know how much that is influencing how I currently feel about the relationship. I had PND and OCD since the birth of DC2 12 years ago, and covid has really made my anxiety much worse. I don't do much out of the house because I don't enjoy it because I'm worried about getting covid. Ironically I've already had it 3 times from the kids who got it from school, so it's not as if all of my protecting myself helps me as I am more likely to get exposed from the kids. But anyway, I find life hard at the moment because of this. Having said that, I have a job that I enjoy, and when I'm at work and interacting with colleagues, I don't feel low or anxious or depressed, I feel ok. My colleagues are lovely and supportive and I enjoy talking to them, I can do my work and concentrate and focus (other than getting sidetracked on MN!!). And all of that makes me wonder if it is the relationship that is the issue, as I am ""fine"" at work. Reading this back it looks as though the relationship is so terrible and I'm sure everyone is going to tell me to LTB! We have had some good times together, but I think maybe the little things that have added up over time have just got to the point where it's too much, and there is nothing left. I can't even sit here and defend what is good. He has been away for 2 weeks with work and asked me the other day if I miss him. I really don't. I can't think of 1 thing that I miss. I've answered my own question really, haven't I? The kids really like him, although they might miss the dog more. I feel guilty about putting them through another of my failed relationships (the first being the one with their dad, I haven't had a string of partners who have been around), and I do feel sad about the relationship ending because I feel bad that it's also potentially ending the relationship that they had with him, and him with them. It's been 5 years, almost half of DC2's life."
"LTB & GAT","(Get a cat) The secret to a happy life"
"Struggling on dating apps as a woman, any advice?","22F here. I just don't know what to do anymore. A pattern has developed of men from tinder ghosting me/stringing me along for an ego boost/putting me on the bench/not replying to the first message/asking me out only to later say they're busy or sick, or only to unmatch me before the date/only wanting ons or fwb. It's not just on tinder, it happens on the other apps too. Normally I think of myself as a pretty girl, not beautiful but definitely not ugly. I'm slim and neat. However, all of this is taking a toll on my self esteem and I'm starting to feel hideous and undesirable. Whenever I find a man attractive he's not into me. I'm not really opting for model looking guys but even the moderately attractive ones don't bite. However, all the men who flock to me/message me first/quickly ask me out are just unattractive to me lookswise and I wouldn't be happy with them. And if they're not unattractive they don't meet my other education criteria such as studying or having a degree, or they're from another country with a completely different culture/religion & I don't want to get involved no matter how much I like them. I've collected a real big number of matches, I've been on tinder for years on and off. I think it's been a year now since I've been actively using it again. It's crazy to me that I literally can't find anyone to date long term. What's interesting though, when I change my location to other countries way more interesting men hit me up, while those in here run like hell from me. I don't get that either. Is it a location issue? I live in a big capital city. I'm starting to feel as though I'm not even worthy enough to be attracted to my partner. People have told me to lower my standards but honestly, would a man date a woman he finds unattractive? I doubt it so I don't see why I should do charity work. In my profile description I stated I'm looking for a ltr. My photos include a full body shot in a midi dress and some other shots, not very provocative. The last photo is mainly a face shot with nicely done hair. I have little makeup, maybe that's the problem? Should I just give up on apps altogether since there's too much competition? I have no opportunities to meet men outside of apps, I'm currently not working but I'm at university. I don't really have friends there to go on parties or activities with. The two guys who approached me were not my type. I don't want to approach random guys as they're literally strangers to me. It seems my only choices right now are to settle for someone I'm not attracted to at all or to accept being single and lonely which is also becoming mentally hard on me since I've never had a boyfriend, never had sex either. It's not about the sex though, I'm just missing companionship and being close to someone."
"Is this a red flag?","Looking for advice please as I’m newish to the dating scene after coming out of a LTR last year. In January I met a guy online, started chatting etc. it was very much a sex thing for us both at first, and we met up a couple of times. After the third meet up, and second time spending the night together we had the conversation of whether this was just a sex thing or maybe a dating thing. We both said we’d like to see where it went, and would maybe like it to be more than sex. Before we first met we had the conversation of how long we’d both been single and he initially said a year and a half. I have since found out, today, via an Instagram stalk (please don’t judge, we all do it) that he actually was in a relationship until at least 3 months before we started chatting. I’m due to see him tomorrow for dinner and an adult sleepover. Should I mention it? Should I be overly concerned that he lied initially when asked? Or should I just think the conversation happened when we were yet to meet and neither of us knew if it would progress, and therefore move on from it? I can’t decide if I’m making a big deal out of the lie in my head, or whether things said before you establish ‘what this is’ can be forgiven/ignored? Any help much appreciated."
"(Remortgage) Mortgage company valued house lower???","We’ve recently had a 40sq metre extension added to our home. We are one of 2 homes on the road that are the exact same inside. My neighbour remortgaged and they said they said it was worth 235 so I said ok ours is bigger so we’ll say 250 they’ve only come back and said 225 not sure how they actually work out this. He came in with another guy and I think was measuring or checking for damp idk they kept using a tool against walls 😂 We Had one done last year before extension and the guy said yep that’s fine no problems in remortgaging with that value so we thought oh we undervalued it ourselves. Last year a guy came and looked round and said he goes by how he thinks we’ll decorate it basically potential of the home. We’re still renovating so I’m wondering has this guy done it on the pool of the property but he can see the high spec of the rest of the house that we have done so far. So now this time they’ve said it’s not worth what we think. I def think it is especially if next doors was worth more as like I say we’ve doubled our floor space downstairs, and we have 2 bathrooms next door only has one? We were hoping to get our ltv down. Any ideas? Thanks"
"Photo of ex?","AIBU to be upset that my partner of 6 years (LT for 3) has put a family photograph of himself his ex and their kids up in his office? For clarity its a photo from the 90s. Kids are all grown up with kids of their own now. I think its weird and really disrespectful to me? AIBU?"
"Dodgy Plumber Legal Action","Plumber undertook to do some work for us. Asked for half the money up front for parts and has fobbed us off for weeks and now is not responding to calls or messages. Last communication was that he couldn't do the work any more and would wire the £600 back to us. Cock and bull story about payment pending but it has never arrived and he will not respond. Sick of it and now want to escalate. Is the best thing to do to pursue him through the Small Claims Court? He does have a Companies House registered business LTD status.Any advice much appreciated."
"To think divorcing is not as easy as people make out?","Everytime I post something about my DH I’m met with unanimous LTB. But it’s not as easy as people make out when you’re poor, have no family or friends support and rely on his family for support as your own mum still talks to your childhood abuser so even the thought of moving back home fills you with dread. I know my life will be worse and my children will be in danger if I leave the safety of my own home. My Inlaws I trust 100% with my kids. If I left DH my relationship with Inlaws would not exist. I couldn’t just turn up with the kids! No way."
"Nightmare roofers, help!","I've had a terrible experience with cowboys High Pitch Roofing ltd. I asked them to fix a leak in the roof and they've caused an even bigger leak, with lots of water coming into the bedroom when it rains! They've been back 3 times to fix the issue but the leak is still there, and they've refused to return to fix it again. They have given me a guarantee of 3 years but obviously it's not worth much if they won't honour it. Danny Grace, the owner, has also sworn and shouted at me a number of times. Please can anyone advise how to proceed and what to do? TIA"
"Is there any possible reason besides intent to cheat?","I realise this might be the most obvious AIBU ever written, but what I'm hoping for is a bit more insight the the questions I'll pose at the bottom beyond the obvious. I was in an LTR. He took a job on the other side of the country, saying it was an amazing opportunity and he'd save money for us to get married. I was invited with him but could not go due to my kids and work but we did heaps of video calls, letters and he visited every month. I had no idea, but he had presented himself as single to his new friends and workmates. Didn't mention me at all . He began a relationship with someone else. He did, after a few weeks tell this woman about me but implied it was complicated. It wasn't at all complicated. We were in a committed relationship supposedly. When I found out obviously I dumped him, but one question is bothering me. He absolutely swears that he never intended to cheat. But AIBU in thinking that by hiding he had a GF he was deliberately leaving his options open? AIBU for thinking therefore that was likely his express intention / wish from the outset? AIBU for thinking that he pretty much wanted to cheat, from before he even met the person he cheated with, and that he was not committed to me as I thought? AIBU for thinking that even without cheating, hiding that you have a long term GF is insulting AF? It is obvious he felt bad, guilty and even hugely regretted it all. But is it just me? It seems like he SET OUT to basically do it? A reminder...I did dump him already. I just have this question bugging me."
"To be a bit irritated by Dh","Dh is a lovely guy. Please no ‘LTB’. I am posting this to gage whether being a bit uptight or I have some grounds to be annoyed. Dh bday was 2 weeks ago. We did a holiday with lots of other couples to celebrate (it’s a big bday) and between us spent thousands to make it special. today, he planned a celebration with the people that couldn’t make the holiday. Just a day of drinking in pubs and bars really. I have had a headache for the last few days - nothing has shifted it. I also get very anxious about social situations sometimes, and I think I was a little anxious about today’s plans. The headache got worse and worse and ended up being a full blown pounding headache, verging on migraine. I felt awful. DH seemed pretty annoyed that I was feeling ill and kept saying ‘I know you can’t help it, but this is shit timing’. Like I didn’t know that! I barely had the energy to speak back to him. the last few days have been crazy for me at work, I’ve had a lot of catching up to do since we got back from holiday. And also I’ve been doing most of the household chores because Dh has been working incredibly long hours. I think we’re both just a bit tired and ratty. anyway - I couldn’t go out with him. I physically couldn’t get out of bed otherwise I would hve thrown up. I just got out of bed now and found the house in a state. He’s not tidied anything away. just feel really annoyed! Am I being silly??"
"Should I LTB?","NC for this one. Feeling very fragile and hoping that posting this will help me get some perspective. Sorry if this is long but didnt want to drip feed. Just for reference, I've been in a sort of long distance relationship for 18 months- we don't live together and for the past few months haven't seen eachother as regularly as I'm living in a different part of the country. But are meant to be exclusive. I recently found out that he still lives with his 'ex' girlfriend and had been lying to me that he lived with an elderly family member that he supported. We'd always met at mine. He insisted they'd broken up ages ago and begged me to give him another chance. I didn't confirm I would- I had other worries; Around the time I found this out, I discovered I was pregnant. Neither of us have any other children, I'm on the pill and have been told I'd struggle to have a baby naturally so it was a massive shock. I didn't tell him straight away, I needed to think about what I was going to do before I told him, especially given what I'd just found out re. lies about his 'ex', and he'salways been pretty clear he didn't want children. But only a couple of days later, I miscarried at 9 weeks. It was a lot to deal with, the bombshell that he was living with his ex etc, then coming to terms with the fact I was pregnant when I never thought I would be, and losing the baby in the same week. I eventually told him everything last week, and he said the clichéd 'You should've told me, I'd have been there for you, I wouldn't have pressured you in to abortion' etc. He said he'd have been 'indifferent' if I'd decided to keep it. But even the same evening I told him, in between him telling me he was sorry I'd gone through it alone, he was cracking jokes about how a baby would've 'ruined' my body anyway and some other vulgar sexual jokes etc. At first i thought it was his was of making light of a dark situation, and I was just happy he didn't blame me or freak out. But now it's bothering me. I never expected him to be devestated or anything, he didn't know I was pregnant until I wasn't, he never wanted to be a parent. But that was his baby, our baby, and it's not even swayed him in the slightest. And once I told him, that was it. The next day he didnt mention it, or check if I was OK or wanted to talk about it. He hasn't even phoned me (just messaged), hasn't offered to come and see me. He was more doting and attentive when I found out about his lies. If anything, he's seen it as an opportunity to side-step the fallout from me finding out about his living situation. Am I expecting too much from him with regards to his reaction/ support after the miscarriage? Or is it not just the hormones making it look worse- and I should run and never look back? Thank you in advance."
"To ask if anyone has ever sued a small business employer","I am going through the process of claiming for unfair dismissal and discrimination against my ex-employer. Unfortunately they are a small business (Ltd comp.) owned and run by someone who treated the business like their own private bank account and therefore there will be no money in the business (I know there isn't - they are spenders rather than savers and I've been involved in the business for many years). They have some personal assets, but the business doesn't apart from assets which are critical to the business operation. I seriously doubt they have the full employer insurance to cover the risk of being sued for unfair dismissal. I have insurance that are providing my legal assistance to take them to a employment tribunal, but if I win how would I ever get compensation?"
"I'm struggling and I don't know what to do","Hey all. NC'd for this thread as it's outing. I am a woman in my late 20s. My dad died a year ago and I've really struggled since then. I've really been struggling lately in general. I was in a long-distance LTR with my boyfriend until about three months ago, but he made some shitty/insensitive comments and told me he didn't want to have kids (neither of us have any) but that we could ""wait and see"" if he changed his mind. I was honestly in a mess about all of this, and broke up with him because I don't think he'll change his mind. I've been trying OLD but good god it's soul-destroying. I'm disabled and fairly ugly (not trying to be self-deprecating, it's true) and it just feels...hopeless. I'm scared to be alone forever and never have kids, and wondering whether to just go back to my ex. I feel like I'm surrounded by happy people and there's just...me, without prospects like some sort of Jane Austen character."
"Amsterdam and RLD","Me and LT partner are talking of a holiday to Amsterdam. He said he wants to see RLD out of curiousity. I feel really put off him now because I've talked before about trafficking and sex slavery and in the past even mentioned places with legalised prostitution still involves exploiting women and girls. I responded unless he could guarantee this wasn't the case then it wouldn't be happening and said he couldn't guarantee thid and I showed him articles about trafficking including a story from a young women who escaped trafficking from this area and what she endured. He said afterwards he gets t and he wouldn't now I've explained it but trafficking is well known. So is what some of these women endure. He wasn't asking to engage in the service but even just going for a look out of curiosity as he said has really made me see him differently because how can you see it as a tourist thing? I don't know what to do. I've always been vocal that any man who engages in paying for this even if its just pics or a dance its a deal breaker because they can never guarantee the women aren't forced and to be willing to risk inflict that on someone is a huge deal breaker. AIBU?"
"School Stress","I'm not very well versed in all this, <waves hands> not v brave and work in a large public sector employment context so generally keep my head down but did start reading here when the prison stuff became news. DC came home from school and was talking with friends about a pshe lesson they'd had in which they'd had to learn about the ""gender unicorn"" and how it was all really contradictory and also based on stereotypes. I googled it and found a page run by TSER that had things on it like, ""it's important we don't use the term sex because of the vagueness of the definition of sex and it's place in transphobia."" Wtf? The gender unicorn diagram is problematic in so many ways and seems completely bamboozling for kids. I emailed school and asked to see the lesson plans and copy of what DC were shown and asked to do. It's all been sent to me along with a message to say it's endorsed by Metro and PSHE Association and is compliant with Dept for Education guidance. Also included was a lesson plan about the Stonewall riots and his they were led by TW (I thought that was contested?) and a glossary that is all based on adherence to belief in gender and erases same sex attraction entirely. The TSER page is full of campaign materials on how to fight single sex colleges in the US (it is mind blowing, truly). I don't really know what to do now. School clearly feel this is entirely above board and presumably would defend against any complaints. It all makes me so uncomfortable. DC is fine. Thinks it's all bonkers and has moved on quickly. I've fallen down a rabbit hole .."
"Hate new job or culture shock?","I ran a consulting business for 6 years which I sold recently. I wanted to specialise in a field and a job came up. Now, I am more than qualified for this role so the technical work is not challenging. The relationships though may be another issue... It may be relevant or not that the ""leadership team"" (LT) is made up of 5 white men. Two weeks into my new job I was asked to investigate something and found a mistake made by a predecessor. LT1 tells me that ""he won't believe it"" until my subordinate checks on my work. Recently I reported on another ongoing error. LT2 says other professionals in my field have seen this work and did not see an issue. LT2 then proceeds to give me an explanation about work in my expertise! LT3 and LT4 make a presentation and I missed part of it. I asked LT3 if I could access the recording which impacts on my work. LT3 asks me what part precisely I needed as he was not willing to share all with me. Since I missed part of it, I was not able to say which part I needed. I am frankly shocked by the complete lack of trust in my abilities. Please tell me if I am being unreasonable. Should I leave or give it some more time?"

"How am I actually supposed to LTB?","Marriage has gone from on the rocks to completely irreparable. I am pretty sure that my wife is having (at least) an emotional affair with a friend of hers - she keeps lying / omitting information about things she does with this person and then saying that I am controlling and paranoid when I find out the truth. I have been looking for somewhere else to live with 4YO - we currently rent from wife's family member and I have to be the one to leave. 4YO definitely coming with me - would completely kill me to leave him behind but also would be impractical for him to stay with wife. The problem is that I cannot even get to referencing on any of the places I have applied for. We live in an expensive area, and I have set my search within 15 miles so that I can commute to work / 4YO's school he starts in September and even then it is slim pickings. I have tried to arrange viewings on countless places the day that they go online, only to be told that they are fully booked. I have applied for everything that I have seen and have been knocked back each time before the referencing stage. I only work part time at the moment (32 hours) but I do make a decent wage and will also receive universal credit and some child maintenance (wife is not a high earner either, but decent full time wage). I don't have anywhere I can stay for more than a couple of nights at a time and that is very disruptive for 4YO. Social housing is completely off the table - I can't apply in my current circumstances and if I could the wait would be years. I just want to make a safe little home for the two of us - it doesn't have to be perfect and I know it will be difficult but I don't seem to have a hope of even trying. So...what do I do? AIBU to expect to be able to rent a home as a single mother?"
"I think ex is being tricky","My dd is considering coming back to live with my dh & I to be closer to her college in August & I have discussed it with her Father which he is more than happy with however…I mentioned to him that I will need to have maintenance as I cannot afford to support her alone & he offered me an amount which honestly seemed quite low given her outgoings but I didn’t question it. I have worked out what she’d be entitled to based on his his Ltd company turnover but he’s now resigned as director & his wife has been appointed as director. He did mention to me that because of specific issues he’s had with his health ( which I know about & aren’t dishonest) his wife would be taking over but I feel it’s very convenient that it’s been done now so if she runs his business he has no responsibility to pay anything. AIBU to assume there’s an ulterior motive?"

If I moved out I could not afford rent for bedroom size needed and could definitely not afford to run a car. Have put name and on housing association list but do not meet criteria.

"Is my partner clueless?","NC for this. Not sure if it’s just my pregnancy hormones causing me to be unreasonable or if my partner is absolutely clueless about how much life is going to change. I’m currently pregnant with our first child, due in June. My partner has just announced that he has applied to be a volunteer and it’s ignited a fiery rage inside me. I’ll explain why… He works full time (as do I but will be taking 9 months mat leave). He plays football two nights a week and hopes to keep this up when baby is here (after the first month or two). This means that two days a week he will be out from 8am-8pm, with the exception of being home for an hour between 5-6. Am I being unreasonable to wonder where he is getting the extra time for to volunteer? Because I don’t fancy being home alone with the baby and dog for more than two nights a week, or at the weekend! It frustrates me that a lot of men don’t consider who is going to be home to look after the baby when they’re swanning off to their extra curricular activities. Please don’t tell me to LTB, because that’ll give him even more time for volunteering and football! YABU = you’re a hormonal, uncharitable bitch YANBU = who does he think he is?!"

"name says it all","Been together nearly 50yrs. It's not always been a bed of roses but the phrase 'marry in haste, repent at leisure is so true. Short LTR before marrying partner who had MH Issues. Got through that reasonably Ok. He went into the wrong career and had to leave not long after starting. Supported him all through that and somehow we've reached retirement age together. Now he's turned to writing - all day, every day. He's got a poor memory so when an idea comes to him he has to write it down - even in the loo, when doing his teeth - any time. I can't talk to him in case he's 'thinking' I'm house bound now and have no social life so it can be very lonely. I've tried dropping hints but he gaslights me saying he does talk to me - but he's not here in his head, or he does that gentle patronising sigh and puts on a listening face but I can tell he's not engaging with what I'm saying. I get one 'peck' a day and 2/3 cuddles if I'm lucky. Otherwise I'm a very poor housewife (due to mobility issues). Just waned to see what the hive think. Don't tell me to LTB as I couldn't face the disruption."
"Counselling","For those who have been cheated on and went for relationship counselling did it help? P (he's not a 'DP' atm!) has admitted to cheating, he's got various reasons that's he's justifying to himself but has said he's sorry and wants to be with me. He hates the thought of relationship counselling but without some assistance I know I can't get through this. I know I should LTB. Especially as his behaviour has been deceitful dishonest numerous times, he hadn't ever crossed this line. I believe he's sorry. I believe (right now) he wants to be with me. I guess im wanting counselling if what he's saying is true, and at least if it's all in vain it'll give me the strength to ltb. Anyone here successfully salvaged a relationship where there was cheating?"

"What’s missing in my relationship to make it happy again?","This might be a strange post as I’m an adult and should know how to have a relationship and know what I want and don’t want, but I’m struggling to work out what’s missing and what I need. LTR with baby and I’m feeling a bit lost. In the start we had sex often and I enjoyed it, he made me feel sexy and wanted (most of the time) We went on amazing dates and had great times together. Roll on to normal life after the honeymoon period ended (3 months in, sadly) and sex dropped because he didn’t want it much. I have a high sex drive and would do it daily whereas he’s happy with once a week/fortnight. I told him communication needs to improve in general as we’d lost our way and we’re like friends. We worked hard and got in a better place, moved in together and had a baby. Now I’m just feeling like a spare part in his life. Communication has dropped again, we rarely have sex and when we do there’s no foreplay etc it’s boring missionary every time and he stops once he’s cum even if I haven’t, I don’t feel desired, I feel fat from baby weight and deep down I feel like he’s not into me anymore because of this. He denies it but most men would wouldn’t they. I feel like there is so much missing that a healthy relationship should have that I broke down crying that I miss the old us. He promised to work on it but nothing has changed. We’re obviously busy with the baby but they sleep well and are no trouble, we have opportunities to talk/ date / have sex he just doesn’t take those chances. I’m fed up being the one to initiate everything and take charge and make effort to get nothing back. I told him I want to split up and co parent amicably because I want to be with someone who desires me, someone I can connect with emotionally and physically, someone romantic, someone who still dates me and makes time for us, I just don’t feel like he’s that anymore and we’re no longer compatible or it would come naturally. He begged me to give him another chance and that he’s neglected us while focusing on the baby but it will change and we can be us again. So now I feel I need to give him an ultimatum over what I actually want from him and us and that if he can’t do it then we’re over for good. I hate that it’s got to this point and that I feel like a teenager when we’re adults with a baby. Am I asking too much to want to feel loved and special? How do I word this without making demands? I want it to come naturally or it will feel awkward giving him a step by step instruction book of my requests. I read a great thread on here last week but I forgot which one it was, a poster replied to it with something that really made me wake up and realise what I deserve, now I can’t for the life of me remember what they said but in the moment it gave me the boost I needed. I’m hoping someone here knows what I’m going through and can advise how I can fix this mess one last time."
"Mobile phone masts","I know I’m being unreasonable but I can’t help it, we’re looking to move house and I don’t want to move right near a mobile phone mast the health implications concern me.

I’m a big worrier about these things, and I know that’s not normal. Do most people not give this a second thought? How close would you live to a mast? Does anyone know what these codes mean and how to actually find out where the large towers are? Thanks"
"Should I become a Ltd company? (Massage therapist)","Hi, hoping I can pick some legal brains please. I am a massage therapist. I’m currently mobile, I am a sole trader, and I have insurance (combined malpractice, public and products liability). I’m a bit of a stickler for doing things by the book, and I’m also a worrier 😂 I have a fear that someone will sue me and the insurance won’t cover it (the main exclusion I’m worried about is a client having a contraindication that means I shouldn’t treat them. I do always check with my insurers before I treat someone with a medical condition, and I don’t treat if it’s not appropriate, or I refer to GP, but STILL I WORRY! A lot of my clients are elderly ladies so there are a lot of medical things!) I’m wondering whether it would be better to become a limited company rather than being a sole trader, so that my liability is limited. BUT - in the case that I was negligent, could someone still sue me personally rather than the company? In which case all the faff of registering as a Ltd company wouldn’t be worth the hassle. In this case, is there any advantage to becoming a Ltd company? Thank you"
"Mortgage Valuation","Posting for traffic! DH and I are remortgaging - 1st time after initial fixed. When we purchased the property 2 years ago a desk top valuation was completed. Now coming to remortgage and the mortgage provider want someone to come in to the property and actually value it. The approximate value we gave to Santander is what Virgin Money gave following a desk top valuation back in July (we didn't go with them in the end because rates started going down) I've been reading up and according to ye olde interweb it's because the lender thinks we might have overstretched and therefore more risk, but a quick Zoopla search shows that what Virgin gave is slap bang in the middle of estimates, in fact we under valued it when filing out the Virgin application. I'm petrified they are going to undervalue by about £40k and bugger up our LTV! In experiences are home visit valuations becoming more normal after COVID or am I massively overthinking this?!!"
"Letter of Claim from dcb legal","Whilst the following may seem very long winded ( apologies) I would like to assure you that this is in fact a very condensed version of the events that I am desperately seeking help for. On 16.10.2023 I received (for the first time ever) from dcbl - Direct Collections Bailifs Ltd a NOTICE OF DEBT RECOVERY dated 11.10.2023 for an unpaid car parking charge - Parking Charge number: 2000012907853 which I was both unaware of and which I never even received either an actual car parking fine for (Parking Charge Notice or PCN) OR any reminder letters!? Ie the first I even heard of such a fine was through this debt collection notice, for an alleged parking offence which took place on 22.08.2023! I contacted the collection office ( dcbl) who sent the letter who advised me there was nothing they could do as this had been passed on to them by their client : Highview Parking Ltd and I needed to contact them, however the period for contesting the fine had passed so I could not even contest a fine - which I had never actually received! I could not find any contact details anywhere online for Highview Parking Ltd ( it was clearly made intentionally difficult to find online) so I contacted CAB for help and advice on (0808 223 1133) I was only able to get through to the consumer helpline who advised that they had already notified trading standards about Highview Parking not sending out parking fines but just skipping straight to their debt collection company ( dcbl - Direct Collections Bailifs Ltd) and getting them to send out collections notices, as they had already had so many complaints of this exact same problem already! They recorded my complaint and gave me reference number REF/18061193 They advised that I need to try and contact the company by email ( [email protected] ) as no physical address was found, and request a copy of the alleged car parking fine by post citing protection of freedoms act not being enforceable if the fine was not received within a 14 day period of the alleged offence and to request a :subject access request ( data protection act 2018) general data protection regulations (GDPR) which I immediately did I then received an automated response requesting proof of identity to which I responded with a copy of my drivers licence on 17.10.2023. I then received another automated email to say they would respond within 31 days!! ( this is already outside of the 14 days from the alleged offence which in itself was dated as 22.08.23) On the 30th day, by which time I had received yet another threatening letter from the collection company dcbl dated 31.10.2023, I received an email with an electronic copy of the alleged PCN ( which to date- 17.02.2024 I have still not had a copy in the post!!) which they allegedly sent me ( again neither this PCN nor any reminder PCNS were ever sent to me by post just straight into a debt collection notice) I was advised they would not engage with me further and I was unable to contest or appeal their fine with POPLA ( parking on private land) but just to contact the debt collection company dcbl to pay the £140.00 fine I strongly disagreed with this and emailed them back to raise a number of issues, Firstly that I was never parked in the car park for the alleged amount of time they had said I had in their response, but had in fact used the same car park twice in the same day ( effectively meaning that the 2.5 hour maximum stay rule was in fact not broken by myself as I had only been parked initially for around 45 minutes before leaving the car park only to return later that day, including witnesses to this) I later found out from CAB that the second biggest complaint they have had about Highview Parking is when people use the same car park on a regular basis and often multiple times a day the company try to fine them for overstaying the maximum allowed time of 2.5 hours I also raised the fact that the burden of proof is by law, on them as the claimants to provide proof that both an initial PCN was sent by post and in deed received AND to provide visual evidence that my vehicle was parked in the car park for the entire length of time which they have claimed it was, without ever leaving and returning later that day as I had already previously explained it was in order to substantiate your alleged claim of exceeding the allowable car parking time. I also questioned the unfairness of not being able to appeal the fine with POPLA. Had I have received the actual fine in the post I would have had the opportunity to immediately appeal ( or of course if I had been in breach of the terms make the initial payment of I believe in the region of £60 reduced to £40 if payed immediately so why would I have not responded!) Unfortunately they have still not responded to my questions and refuse to respond or engage with me just keep referring me to the debt collection company who by now have sent a further four letters dated: 28.11.2023 -FINAL NOTICE OF DEBT RECOVERY 27.12.2023 - NOTICE OF INTENDED LEGAL ACTION- UNPAID PARKING CHARGE £140.00 16.01.2024- SOLICITORS REMINDER LETTER - UNPAID PARKING CHARGE NOTICE AND 12.02.2023 - LETTER OF CLAIM ( asking me to pay the £140 now due) This is NOT about the money, had I have been in the wrong and had I have a actually received the original PCN I would have paid the original amount of around £60.00 ( all of these very intimidating and threatening letters continued to arrive despite my constant contacting them to raise awareness of the matter and letting them know that I was seeking advice from CAB) I have also made them aware that the company are under investigation by trading standards for the complaint I made but The most recent letter, received from dcbl today, 17.02.2023, dated 1202.23 is a LETTER OF CLAIM requesting I make the £140.00 as a ‘formal letter of claim in accordance with the Pre-action Protocol for Debt Claims’ At this point I would like to say that CAB. have now said that they don’t know what else to suggest!?! I would be so grateful if someone could please give me some advice or help in the matter as I truly am at breaking point and don’t know what else to do Thank you"
"Child Maintenance","I've been split with my dds father for 2 years now, he's always paid £120 a week for the two children which was a private arrangement but the amount was worked out on the CMS calculator at the time. He takes home around £4000 a month but I don't have access to the actual figures any more. He has just told me he will be reducing my child support to £180 a MONTH for both children and that I'm welcome to go to CMS as he has checked the figure with them. He hasn't changed jobs but is self employed. In the past he talked about how he could reduce his child support bill to his older children's mother - he said he would discuss this with his accountant and possibly start a Ltd company. I told him this was disgusting and to just pay his way properly so it was dropped. I'm now worried he has done this to me and CMS will be unable to get the full amount from him. Does anyone have any experience of this or advice? Is there a way I can report it or have it looked into?"
"middle age - not 'invisible'","maybe I'm not alone with this observation. but since being visible middle age <sobs> I get approached a lot by pre-teen children, older women, families on the train etc. often they ask direction or something from a high shelf. once a young one asked me to play along as she wanted to get a way from a creep that was following her in a shopping centre. dunno if I should be annoyed or honoured. is it an extension on wife work or instinct that if in trouble a woman is more linely to be a safe person."
"... to ask if you are in a sexually ""compatible"" relationship?","If you are in a long term relationship, do you think you are sexually compatible?

I have a great DH in so many respects, fortunate with jobs, finances, health, kids and many many other things. But I think we're just very different with respect to sexual compatibility. YABU: I'm in a LTR, and of course we're sexually compatible YANBU: I'm in a LTR, and no we're not really sexually compatible :( Note I'm not interested in any details. Just general comment and a yes/no/vote is OK."

"He doesn’t like sex","LTR and DP has admitted he doesn’t like sex very much and has a low sex drive. I knew early on he wasn’t the type of man to take the lead and rip my clothes off every day, but I learned to accept not all men are like that and enjoyed the sex for what it was as I love him and we had great chemistry outside of the bedroom. He has now told me he only has sex with me for my benefit as I have a high sex drive. This has really upset me as I thought it was a mutual need. I always have to initiate but I don’t pester, we have sex maybe once a week at most so I reach for the sex toys in between which he knows about and dislikes. He has never initiated and 9/10 he needs to take viagra. We are only 28 and 26. He did make the effort to see his gp and they didn’t have any concerns about his physical health, they suggested it may be a confidence thing or performance anxiety. He saw a counsellor for his mental health who were happy and dismissed him. I have never pushed it and never raise the subject, if he turns me down I accept it and pretend I’m fine. It makes me feel like a desperate sex pest, which I’m far from, I just long for regular sex that he also wants. We have a 2 year old and he works long hours so he is very tired which I respect, but when we have the opportunity he either isn’t in the mood or can’t get an erection. I know it’s a genuinely low sex drive and not caused by an affair or porn, but I’m looking for advice from women who have been in this position how you improved your sex life. I don’t want to leave him but I do want him to desire me and make more effort, I’m not sure if this will ever be possible."

No family in same couhtry. Job which is like going through a wringer every week. If we separated it would be alternating weeks. He has lied and cheated. I feel like we have descended into a fucked up sister/brother or mother/son dynamic. I can't trust him and he tries to outwit (gaslight) me...unfortuantely (fortunately) I am cleverer than him. But I still enjoy his company. We can still have lots of fun, even after 20 years together. Also I love my home (3-bed shoebox flat). I love the area of town we live in. I love being in a family. I love his family. I love our family unit. I really like his friends. I like having sufficient money for a fairly decent life. If we separate most of this goes. But I can't take the up and down of the lies, the suspision, the person I turn into, being treated like a mug, the self-hatered for remaining. I am too scared to finish it. I can't face losing all the good and am not convinced that all the bad disappears once we are not romantically together. What happens when he gets a new gf (because he will) and I'm stuck like a lonely lemon every second week missing him? I hate it when I read ltb. If only life were that simple. I wish I could leave me. Just cut a body bag in space-time. The only solution. (I am having therapy btw.)"
"AIBU to offer advice?","Totally ready to be told I'm being unreasonable. Our friends (a couple) have both individually told DH that they are in a lot of debt. AIBU to offer to go through their finances with them and give them some advice? For context I'm an accountant and have helped with his tax return before (he is self employed) so they have shared an element of personal finance with me previously. In my current role I set budgets for a living. I'm not coming at this from a nosy viewpoint at all (I'm actually really busy at work and would rather not get involved) I'm just really worried about them, and I have the experience I think would help. I'm especially wondering about if it would be more beneficial for him to become a ltd co, if he is close to the vat threshold, and what their mortgage payments could look like in a year, which isn't necessarily things they would look into themselves. We are very old friends (20 years) So let me have it, would I be unreasonable to send them a text to offer?"
"Snapchat friend suggestion - does this imply a GDPR breach?","I recently joined a national professional organisation. It took some time to receive my membership pack and I had to chase them up more than once, so my confidence in their processes was a little shaky right from the start. I had some email correspondence from a <Joe.Bloggs>@<organisation>.co.uk who also called me on my mobile to discuss my query. So I've just fired up Snapchat to check my DCs activity through the family monitoring service. This is literally the only use I have for Snapchat. My DC is my only ""friend"" and all privacy settings are tightly locked down. I 100% have not allowed Snapchat to see my Contacts. But my top friend suggestion is now ""Joe Bloggs"". I can only assume that he uses Snapchat on the same phone he uses for professional calls and has shared his Contacts (including my phone number) with Snapchat, allowing it to draw a connection between us. Is this a GDPR breach, and if so how should I approach it? Regardless, I'm really disappointed and my confidence in this organisation - whose sole function is to provide support to members experiencing professional difficulties - is now really low. Advice appreciated."
"To ask how to leave when you feel so downtrodden","Been with H for 8 years, married for 5, have one child. Anyways at the start of our relationship, I was an option for about a year and I didn't know. Then he told me a year after and it felt like a kick in the teeth and the other(s) were also way more accomplished than me. Then we bought a flat and he couldn't cope because we were limited in funds and the commute was further, so I took another job to keep afloat. He got OW. Seeing as we just bought a new flat, he ended with her and we tried again. And then marriage and kids the year after. Obviously this was another smack to my self esteem throughout this and yes I should've LTB before I had the kid. But I was the idiot. Anyways we have regular arguments that I'm not doing enough again. I work full time, am a first time mum to a 1 yr old with sleep issues, have a house now to deal with. Over the week, I caught a nasty flu and today only started to feel better. My H has a thing about gym, I'm usually pretty good at my fitness but this has slipped in the last 3 months since back to work. I'm still a size 4-6 and he's going off on one about me looking haggard and fat and dumpy. And I just broke down because I was so exhausted, am also on my first day of period as well. I'm not sure with our history I can stay any more, i constantly feel like it's just not enough.j But I don't know how to separate, I have family and they know his ways but I don't know how to even start this conversation with him without him blowing up- need a handhold."
"Fighting Court Order to change Childs surname @ 5 (its been the same since birth, but ex wants his instead of mine - despite not coming to 5/6 registry appointments)","Some help would be amazing - the very short story- My son was born, we moved out of the shared flat within 2 months and mainly stayed at my parents during this time as my ex was vile, he refused to come to the registry office 5 or 6 appointments on the last he was at home and his decision was to stay at home and get drunk in the morning chain smoking in the flat with no windows open, on my return from the registry office he hit the roof as his name wasn't on the birth certificate ""I told you had to come in person I can't put you on it without you being in the room"" and then ""why have you used your surname it should be mine"" to which my reply was - YOU should have come yourself, why should I use your name if you can't be bothered to register him, which should be a enjoyable thing for most parents to do"", I packed a bag and left. and then moved out back to my parents since he took me to court sadly magistrates who were moronic at best - he didn't apply for PR so they could make a judgment they awarded it anyway, WTF it should have been thrown out, they also awarded contact something which had never been denied, he was supposed to arrive for supported contact with myself every other Saturday 10am for 2hrs - what he managed is a sorry 8 visits in over 1 year, has arranged 13 visits, has cancelled 18 visits, No show for 1 and being late on 2 or 3 has had the opportunity to visit 43 times and should have in accordance with the order. the magistrates also ordered a specific order to change my sons name mine effectively as a middle name - despite my son knowing his name, anyone who asked what's your name my son said his full name, plus he was already learning the letters of his name - Plus the fact that I have proof by way of text messages this is a way for him to make my life difficult - ""you won't be able to go on holiday"" and text stating my ex feels he will be able to gain with my son having his name "" once I am on the birth certificate I will be able to get on the council"" - so I broke the court order hold my hands up. BUT HE ALSO BROKE THE CONTACT ORDER - HE FAILED TO ARRIVE - So he took me back to court during which the idiotic magistrates AWARDED him first price for failing to arrive - they removed all the supported contacts and lengthened the time. When I protested "" the child is that much older - NO his 5 he is sill a baby, who is gullible, easily manipulated. and the second part of his award is I now have to do a reasonable excuse hearing for the name change - the magistrates can only offer 1 reason to change my son’s surname ""to provide linkage to father"" IF YOU TURN UP< BE PRESENT>BE FUN>BUILD A RELATIONSHIP would be a good place to start - I have a whole list against. Has anyone got any advise because it would seem these people have zero interest in anything I have to say"
"How to handle title/mortgage","Would love some advice from MN on a house purchase. I have recently found a house I would love to buy in the perfect location, near DC's school etc. I am planning to use my inheritance and all my savings as deposit (70% LTV) but mortgage is tricky as my income is very low, taking time off work due to disabled DC. I can technically get a mortgage together with DH but he will be contributing nothing financially. As my income is a fraction of his and unlikely to increase much, I will be putting myself at high risk in case of a split of assets (hopefully not, but you never know). I plan to sell in a decade and downsize taking my savings back. How do I ensure legally that the property will be mine and I am able to take the equity for myself in case something goes wrong in our marriage? Any advice to protect myself is welcome!"
"Why can't I just get past this?","During my upbringing, I was simultaneously told that I needed to be married in order to have any hope of living a meaningful existence but that I lacked any of the physical qualities to attract a man and also that I lacked any of the other qualities (submissiveness, compliance etc) to make up for that fact but that getting married (and changing myself so that that might be possible) was the only thing I needed to focus on. Education and a career was a waste of time because men weren't interested in those things. Even though if all the above were true, I'd need to he able to support myself, surely. But no, the best I could hope for is that I dampen down who I am, become as inoffensive and middle of the road as possible and hope that someone, who had exhausted all other options, might settle for me. I'm appoproaching my 50s now. Because the above was such a deeply entrenched core belief, I've never really had a real relationship. I've dated and had flings but, because I always knew that I wasn't LTR material, I never took them seriously or ever regarded any of them as potentially long term and tended to end relationships after 6 months. I've now, finally, been in a relationship for 18 months. He's great. But I still can't get away from the past. Because I don't have a perfect body, because I don't have a beautiful face, because I'm not unopinionated, docile, compliant etc I can't imagine how he could possibly be genuinely interested. I can't see how he is not comparing me to others and being constantly disappointed, I believe he is settling for me because he's concluded that, at his age, he probably isnt going to do any better. I've had counselling and therapy. Logically, I know that the above was wrong. I don't apply the same standards to other people. I'm pretty confident in every other area of life but because I'm not what I'm 'supposed' to be, I feel none of everything else I am matters. But I'm so harshly critical of myself. Even when I'm feeling good and positive about myself and confident, that little voice pops up reminding me of the ways in which I fail and the confidence just dissipates. Even if I try and ignore it, or use positive self talk to quieten it. It's too late and the damage is done."
"ECG holter report - can someone explain the report.","For a colleague , currently they are on LTS and have a review with HR, who have asked for an update on their health. They can’t get an GP appointment until after the HR appointment so asking if anyone can translate the report for them, as they are wanting to go back to work ASAP. They were in bed mostly during the 48 hr monitoring due to being ill (no fever). On day 5/6 of a winter bug (they basically slept for the most part) Both the colleagues GP and the work OH (doctor) have signed colleague off as not fit for work however they may be able to return if the report is normal as they can be put on medication to treat/help ongoing symptoms while investigations by consultant are ongoing. The medication however can cause heart issues however not recommended as colleague has episodes of heart palpitations/fluttering/unconscious passing out. The report says also no symptoms reported however colleague did advise the nurse that they had experienced fluttering. Can anyone help with the report please"
"To think I shouldn't be fussy about picking a job if I'm unemployed?","I'm unemployed with a 9 month career gap for various reasons. I have 4 interviews this week for the same/similar positions but at different companies. I'm grateful to have even been given an interview as I know a career gap is pretty frowned upon, and I know how awful the current job market is. The thing is I'm not sure if I'm being naive/dumb to ignore red flags. For example: One of the jobs is at a tiny company (<10 employees), and completely remote. Because it's such a small and new company there are no employee reviews available online so I don't know what it's like to work there. It's also a 'private' company (I don't know what that means) Another has consistently bad Glassdoor reviews from people who I would be working with and people with the same job title I'd have saying it's a toxic, bullying culture with toxic management. This was the role I'm most interested in but the reviews are putting me off... I did interview with this company a couple of years ago and found the interviewers seemed rude and disinterested (despite giving me a job offer after which I declined) The other 2 have average Glassdoor reviews and are average roles, nothing particularly standout about them. High workloads, long hours and the expectation to work late but that's pretty standard for the area of work I'm in. Do you think I should just go for all of these opportunities as I am unemployed or would that be a mistake?"
"What can I challenge as a trustee? Is this legal? Conflict of interest?","I'm a trustee of a trust which benefits from dividends from a Ltd company (the trust is one of 5 shareholders of the company). There are 2 other trustees and both have recently been appointed as directors of this company. Without notifying me they have started paying themselves (they don't know that I know yet). The amount that they are paying themselves equates to more than last year's dividends paid to the trust. So my questions are ...what can I challenge as a trustee? Do they have a conflict of interest as a result of paying themselves? Should I have been notified or even had a say in their decision to pay themselves. Note - only the 'first-named trustee' gets to vote as a shareholder. I'm not the first-named trustee. Thank you!"
"To reconcile or not to reconcile","…that is the question 😂 I posted a little while ago about finding my partner was searching on Google that he doesn’t find me attractive since having our baby. How I had seen that he was also searching “is it cheating if I imagine I’m with other women when having sex with my partner” and “I have to fantasise about other women when I have sex with my partner.” It hurt me so much as we’ve only been together 2 years and at the time I was 7 months post partum and feeling awful about my body as it was. So I didn’t react well and we ended up having a massive fight where he said he loves me but the lust/desire has gone, so I kicked him out. I was blindsided by the way he felt, we had sex daily and he made me feel wanted and lusted after. Although he was struggling to keep erect during sex and I did start to wonder if it was to do with me, but he insisted it wasn’t and made out he was suffering with ED. But clearly it wasn’t that it was how he felt about me! Instead of leaving quietly for a few days (we live together at mine but he has his own flat he can go to), he called his family and involved all of them in our private drama. Then stayed with family for a short while playing the victim that I kicked him out (obv not saying why) before going back to his own flat. He spent about a week trying to win me back, and he went to 1 counselling session as a way of saying he will change the way he thinks and behaves - there are other issues too that come from his abusive childhood that need to be ironed out in counselling. But after more arguments in that first week we weren’t talking at all and he then went out on a work do (which was just a lunch) and was gone out for 10 hours whilst I was caring for our sick baby at home. So we argued again as I felt like he was behaving like he was single and happy we were over, and so yet again it was back to not talking. Since that taste of freedom he got, he was cold and horrible towards me, telling me he only cares about our daughter. He has also seemed fine with the split even though now he says he’s not and was devastated. He was really distant towards me, which yes may be because of all the arguments - I also said hurtful things like it was a mistake to ever be with him - so I don’t really knock him for that. But at one point I tried to reconcile and he seemed very cold and again more arguing occurred because of this. We are in the third week now and I find out that he’s got a new flat and moved 30 mins away from me and our baby and doesn’t see it as a big deal as he’s now closer to work. He also signed back up to dating sites and was messaging women. A friend saw him on there and sent me the screenshot. He denied it initially until I showed him proof. But since then he apologised for doing it and has been saying all the right things about how he loves me and we can work on this for our baby and how everything’s got out of hand. That he was only trying to move on as I initiated the split and that he would have never ended the relationship if he’d had a choice. Part of me would love to reconcile, but part of me feels like had I not reached out over him on dating sites he would have never even tried. Also the original issue - that he isn’t attracted to me - still stands. Although he is adamant that he is, it was just him being stupid and the thrill of imagining I’m another woman - which makes me sick. I have agreed to go to counselling - whether it brings us back together or not I feel it’s important for our daughter to be amicable. Does this seem fixable? Was it all a bit over the top of me to LTB or do you genuinely think that it’s something that can’t be worked past. Just wanting to hear from anyone who’s had trust and hurt and managed to reconcile? I mean I know people can come back from worse things than this, I’m just concerned he was 1 step away from cheating on me with how he felt. Worst part is after 3 weeks of trying to keep it private in the hope of a reconciliation, I finally told my family and friends (after dealing with it alone for so long) and now they all hate him so this makes a reconciliation even harder."
"Finnish Study: found no convincing evidence that gender-referred youth have statistically significantly higher suicide rates as compared to the general population","https://mentalhealth.bmj.com/content/27/1/e300940.info https://segm.org/Suicide-Gender-Dysphoric-Adolescent-Young-Adult-Finland-2024 Summary A recent study published in BMJ Mental Health, All-cause and suicide mortalities among adolescents and young adults who contacted specialised gender identity services in Finland in 1996–2019, analyzed overall mortality and suicide mortality among gender-referred young people in Finland over a 25-year time span (n=2,083; median age 19 years; median follow-up 5.7 years). The study defined young people as those referred to gender services under the age of 23. The study found that suicide among young people <23 (""youth"") seeking gender services in Finland is an unusual event (0.3%, or 0.51 per 1,000 person-years). Further, in comparing gender-referred youth to a cohort of matched controls (n=16,643), the study found no convincing evidence that gender-referred youth have statistically significantly higher suicide rates as compared to the general population, after controlling for psychiatric needs. The study also did not detect a statistically significant association between gender reassignment and the risk of suicide. The study did, however, find a statistically significant relationship between a high rate of co-occurring mental health difficulties and increased suicide. The authors concluded that ""it is of utmost importance to identify and appropriately treat mental disorders in adolescents experiencing GD [gender dysphoria] to prevent suicide, while also noting that ""the risk of suicide-related to transgender identity and/or GD per se may have been overestimated."""
"How to stop bickering!!?","Name change for this! Married 7 years, together for 10, two young children under 3, the youngest is 7 months old. I'm just exhausted with our constant bickering. We do love each other, I'm sure of that, and this is not a LTB situation. We just seem to niggle and bicker constantly. We are both exhausted with two very bad sleepers, very little family support, my DH has a stressful job and works lots of hours. He's not around much during the week during the kids waking hours. I'm just tired. I don't feel like we are a team. We aren't even affectionate because I have a baby glued to my boob and I feel touched out. He does pull his weight but the bulk falls to me. I don't feel that we laugh and have fun much, we don't have the time even for a conversation some days. I just don't know how to get 'us' back. Does it just come back in time? I am confident we will weather the storm but if anyone has any tips on how to stop niggling and get on better, I'm all ears ;("
"To LTB for eating the ice cream? (Lighthearted. Ish.)","Preface - DP is fabulous. We are very much a team. OR SO I THOUGHT. We have two DC - DD who is 3 and a demanding tantrum filled threenager, and DS who is 3.5 months. DP is currently in the US for 2+ weeks for work. In the week before he left we went to the shops and I picked up a Ben and Jerry's low fat ice cream tub which I had tried previously and really enjoyed; I pointed this out to him at the shop when I popped it in the trolley. I didn't specifically buy it for me, we generally share these things after dinner. We didn't eat it before he left. Today and this evening have been haaaard work with various meltdowns and screaming fits, and so after a struggle to get DD to bed I thought I know, I'll get DS down then pour myself a glass of wine and eat the ice cream. Note - I would have replaced the ice cream before DP's return for him to also enjoy one evening. I would not have hidden the fact that I'd eaten the ice cream. But.... It's not bloody there!!! He's bloody eaten it and not even told me!! He knows I'm here with the two kids, by myself. He could have let me know he'd eaten it! WIBU to LTB over this? Seriously reconsidering our upcoming nuptials... 😂"
"Read this - amazing advice!","I just want to come on here to commend this column to everyone - https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/30/my-wife-and-i-argue-so-much-but-she-will-not-go-to-counselling-philippa-perry#comment-163752842 This letter to Philippa Perry could have been written by me a few years ago. My husband and I argued about everything and anything (although obviously it was always the same thing really!) He was 'wrong', and I was 'right' (even when I admitted he was right, but just expressed it in totally the wrong way!) He treated me very badly, and yet I didn't want to just LTB - we have children who need us together if at all possible (I really believe this, unless in the case of horrible abuse, obvs.). So I needed a way of staying together but us both improving, and our situation and quality of life improving. So we both went to therapy, separately and together, and the stuff we have learnt reflects so much of what Philippa Perry writes in her amazing book and in this column. What I learnt was that I couldn't change him, but could always work on myself and my own reactions to what he did and said. This isn't the same as blaming myself for his poor behaviour. But it means taking responsibility for my own feelings and reactions. We still argue. We're still different. Our sex life isn't the best. But we're getting there. And as PP says in this reply, there are reasons we were attracted to people who were different from ourselves. The key changers for me have been: to really look at myself and be curious about my own feelings and where they come from, what triggers are being set off, etc. Why am I feeling hurt, superior, arrogant, upset, etc. even when he has acted poorly, not to focus on that alone but to look for the good in him. Making him the enemy had the effect that he acted worse. Focusing on his good points was key to breaking the cycle. to be able to distance myself from my own anxiety about how he acts, and hold in tension the idea that 'yes he is acting badly, but I don't need to let it affect me to the extent I used to. It doesn't need to hurt me as much as it did'. Keeping on 'breaking the cycle'. Sometimes one of us has to back down even when it's not 'fair'. But the result overall is win/win for everyone. I know it sounds like I am excusing him, but actually, the net effect of all this has been that we have both started treating each other so much better, and things are really improving. We have been through years of unhappiness, but genuinely don't have that now. I wanted to post this because I'm sure there are people out there on MN like me - not really satisfied with our marriages but not jumping to the usual MN 'LTB' solution, which I know would just be a different sort of horror - for me and our kids. But also needing to move forward positively. I hope this helps. Not really interested in anyone coming on to criticise or rain on this - just to say please do have a read of Philippa Perry if you haven't before!"
"Did you tell them?","So I've recently split from my LTR of 10 years, I've been unhappy for some time and I've tried talking to him about our issues many times. Big one is intimacy, he wanted it I didn't, among others ranging from being negative about everything, not bothering round the house, and generally just being a passenger in his own life and leaving me to drive. I just wanted more and have for some time. No kids BtW. Anyway 4 months ago I started to engage in an EA with someone at work, not sugar coating it I knew what I was doing, and thats when I really started to feel the issues in my relationship and feel terribly unhappy with DP. I told DP I wasn't in love with him, I wasn't happy any longer and wanted out. I'm not 100% sure if the OM was just the push to the inevitable or if I actually want someone else. Now 2 months later ex is still devastated and can't understand what went wrong, he's going to my family members and crying and saying he doesn't know what he did wrong and what he should do to fix it. I don't want to go back to him, I want to move on, but question is should I tell him there was someone else just to give him some closure? Will it help him move on or will it just hurt him more?"
"Business credit score at ‘maximum risk’","I can’t find anything beyond ‘how to build your credit score’ online so I’m wondering if anyone can help before I call Experian tomorrow (I’m quite an anxious person and will be worrying about this all night!) So I recently applied for a business flexi-loan to manage cash flow due to repeat late payments. The company is profitable and we’re on our second year in business as an LTD (I was a sole trader before). I applied because my bank told me I was eligible, after a week and being told I was eligible I was declined with no reason as to why. I went through Iwoca. I’ve just looked at my business credit score and it says ‘maximum risk’. I am really confused and panicking about it. I have never taken out business credit, don’t have a business overdraft or taken out any business loans before and I pay suppliers on time though I don’t have any direct debits. My personal credit score is good and I’ve never missed a personal credit card payment or anything like that. There’s barely any information on Experian except saying I have two searches on the file which just says ‘web enquiry’. I am really confused about what this means and how this could affect my business. Any insight will be very helpful, thank you."
"Affair -help me understand what I’m doing? Has anyone been through similar?","I’m married with older/teen dcs and am in an EA with a slightly younger man (no dcs) he is married but they’re living apart. It’s only been going on for a few weeks. I haven’t been very happy with dh for quite a while now. He thinks he is a great guy (has absolutely no self-reflection/modesty) but he’s done some horrible things to me that I know if I listed here you’d all be telling me to ltb. The main reason I haven’t is down to financials. He is (I think) financially abusive. He owns £££ in assets but I have no access to any of this information. He pays all bills. His business is extremely complicated and not straightforward at all and if he died or had an accident I wouldn’t have the first clue where to start. When I voice these fears to him he just wriggles his way out of it saying things like “the solicitors will deal with it” or “you’ll be fine”. The reality is he just doesn’t want to get me involved. We have never been an equal partnership in any way. I stayed home to look after the dcs whilst he has always worked 10-12 hour days. Another thing that really pisses me off is that I was left alone for years bringing up the children whilst he escaped to the office and wouldn’t even take a day off even if I was really ill, yet now this past year (now the dcs are all grown up and flying the nest!)he’s decided he is working from home now and that’s that. I get no say in this (and it’s driving me fucking mad). He is incapable of having a conversation- everything is about him and his interests which are moaning about his work and the economy. I could go on forever. But, fast forward to now. I can’t stop thinking about this man. I’ve had better conversations with him in the last few weeks than I’ve had in my life with dh. I can tell he is kind and very emotionally aware. He does a lot of charity work and cares about the environment etc. (Dh is a climate denier/brexit voting/very right wing type and moans about anything an everything - he loves the sound of his own voice and has to control/hold court over every conversation). I have come to fear the dcs leaving home and being left alone with him. I feel so lonely even when he’s around. I want to be with someone I can feel secure with and talk to about crap. Im feeling a bit infatuated with this man which I know is ridiculous. I’ve lost half a stone in 2 weeks - I can’t eat or sleep. What is weird is that despite the problems with dh I’ve never looked at another man or entertained ideas of sleeping with someone else. Then I met this man and it all just flipped on it’s head, I can’t think of anything else. I never fancy anyone - Why am I so attracted to this man? I don’t really know why I’m even posting except to get it off my chest- I’ve no one to talk to in RL and wouldn’t tell even my closest friend. Has anyone else been through anything similar? If so, what happened? Is it just hormones? Im not going to ask or expect anything from this man, I’m letting him take the lead. I feel like I will accept any crumbs he throws my way! I don’t mind people being honest but please don’t be horrible."
"To feel this way","Need some advice, I’m in uncharted territory right now. I had a serious row with DP about 2 weeks ago and my mind set has fundamentally changed. A lot of things had built up to the point of this row, however I think this row has made me snap... I feel like I’ve had an epiphany and have accepted that me and DC will always be secondary in his life. His “real” family are his siblings and parents and I am the villain in his story. Crazy part is that as a result of this, I’ve decided that I don’t want to LTB. It sounds illogical I know but I considered the following: If I LTB then my position doesn’t change. It’s still me and the DC but with less resources. Whereas if I don’t LTB then it’s still me and DC but at least I won’t have financial worries and an upheaval in my life. I worked damned hard all of my life to get us to where we are (not super wealthy but comfortable). He did about 10% but I was the one who researched, planned and executed. Ultimately he is reaping the rewards of my labour and I don’t see why I have to give up our lifestyle for him. I should be able to enjoy the fruits of my labour, not him and by extension his family. I’ve informed him that as much as I’d love to LTB I just won’t. I told him that I’m happy to keep it civil and polite as you would with a coworker. We are no longer partners. We should consider ourselves something akin to coparents. He has reciprocated. I don’t know his reason for agreeing nor do I care. The issue is that being civil and polite is proving to be incredibly difficult. I don’t even feel like talking to him so we just avoid each other (no unpleasantness just ignoring). The atmosphere is tense and I worry how that will affect DC. There are even times I want to concede just to return to normality but then I remember how we got here. My heart is hurting and I don’t know what I’m doing."
"Why did I stay?","Can't discuss this with anyone in real life . A friends son who I am very close to (unofficial God parent type thing) has just got engaged to his long term girlfriend. Gorgeous, happy news. They got engaged in Barcelona. All lovely. But my ltr broke up because he didn't want to marry me. He had gone back and for lying to me and promising. He had even told me that he was proposing in Barcelona and booked it, until a week before when he said he had changed his mind and wouldn't be. We didn't end up going to Barcelona as I was too upset but I limped on in that relationship for another 2 years!! After the gut punch of the reminder this morning, it's led me to think why on earth did I stay??? I used to read threads on here where people would say to other posters in a similar circumstance ""just ask him"" and I would think ""no way I could do that, he would say no"" and yet I still stayed ! I feel like banging my head on the table at my own lack of self esteem and that I didn't get out sooner."
"OLD for the Over 50s","I have certainly gathered on here that OLD is no place for the faint hearted Was on PMF for a bit where a lot of women seemed to be scammers or just escorts. Recently joined Silver Singles where my initial impression is that most of the women on there are genuine and quite keen on a LTR. Obviously I don't know what the men are like but interested to hear views on the site as a whole"
"To be rethinking this whole thing now…","I have been seeing somebody for about 6 months now. I have quite an on and off history with him but we broke things off and quite a few years have gone by since. he’s had another relationship since then and I have one DC from a previous relationship. He knows about them but hasn’t met them yet but he seems to be nice about it and doesn’t seem to mind that I have a child and we are giving things another go. He seemed to me like he had matured I recently heard from an old friend and we got chatting, (we have known each other since primary school) and we were just having a catch up so I thought. One of her relatives is his ex girlfriend and they were in a LTR She has started telling me about their break up out of the blue and saying that the reason they split up was because he didn’t want children and that apparently he calls children horrible names and really doesn’t like them? I have no idea if this is true or not or if it’s to try and put me off him? What would you think?"

"LTR and kids, is this normal?","I've been in a relationship with my partner for 14 years since we were 18, not married. We have three young children under 6. Before children we had a good relationship. I guess at times I felt it could have been more passionate, but he's a great man; reliable, kind, loyal, hard working, supportive. He still is all of those things. BUT since kids we bicker constantly about parenting. We were raised differently and our approach to parenting seems to differ regularly. Little things like he's the stricter one, he is rigid in his approach to parenting whereas I'm happy to flex depending on the situation. He also has a fairly negative view on the kids and our life in general I find, he's just been a bit glass half empty I suppose. I'm sick of the bickering, it's affecting his I view him and definitely has affected our sex life. My mood is starting to go down in his company as it just feels like constant conflict between him and the kids, even though I know he wants the best for them and genuinely thinks he's parenting for their benefit (perhaps he is!). Is this normal? I mean, the regular bickering about parenting. And if so, does it naturally improve? I'm worried what state our relationship will be left in if it doesn't improve. I'm also wondering if it's a communication flaw with us that we need to get help with. We're both committed to the relationship and our family, but I want a happy household and I'm not sure if we're just in a normal young family rut, or if there's something deeper amiss."
"“I need a holiday from my holiday”…","Boohoo. Having dinner with a couple of friends who live abroad tonight and they were telling us about how they “need a holiday from their holiday” because after all the skiing and mountain climbing they’ve been doing, sightseeing and partying in London is just over the top. They also managed to share how they go on holiday every 6 weeks or so as their business manages itself these days. Before anyone rushes to state the obvious, yes, I 100% am jealous, and would absolutely kill to go on precisely the kind of holiday they described. Magic away our little children, the aches that come with many hours at the office followed by bouncing babies up and down to convince them to sleep. Drinking wine, without worrying about a 5am wake up because our DD needs a pee 😂😂😂. It would be too beautiful. So now for my AIBU… AIBU for wanting to throttle my holiday weary friend, or better still, sentence her to just one week of babysitting? YANBU: yes, a bit of babysitting will absolutely re-energise her in preparation for her upcoming trip to mount Everest / Maldives / <insert desirable location of choice>. YABU: you chose to have children, you are so bitter, why all the violent talk, maybe you need professional support, have you considered therapy etc etc."
"to learn to be less soft?","My sibling is needy, tends to use me or manipulate me to get embroiled in drama. She means well and is lovely, but that's the score. My 2 closest friend barely bother with me now, but are happy to put their issues on to me every few months in their own time. When I share my issues, they don't seem too interested. I have just come out of a LTR and am quite alone, but even my ex, who is still a friend, doesn't seem to give a shit about me. I have noticed that my defining feature is making excuses for people. I am happy to find the good rather than the bad. But i think this has held me back somehow, over time. I now have practically no one in my camp, but i am still there for them. How to manage this? How to grow a spine and be more selfish? More self focused?"
