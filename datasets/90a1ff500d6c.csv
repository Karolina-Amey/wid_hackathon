I'm really upset, like hyperventilating crying upset, and the only thing that I feel will make it better is to hurt myself. This is something I haven't done in years, and not a soul knows I've done it in the past (very creative with hiding cuts in the creases of limbs etc.). I'm absolutely not going to hurt myself tonight. My 15 yr old girl is upstairs in her room, she's number one in the list of priorities and thus would never do it under the same roof as her, but she goes to her dad's for the night tomorrow and I'm planning on doing it then. It gives me a sense of control when everything else is going crazy. My ""D""H has broken me, again. He cheated on me in 2013, he gaslit me for years, even when I was begging him for the truth, until I found out for sure in 2018. I stayed, we ""recovered"", he did so much to regain my trust. Or so I thought. We own a small business (well smallish, we employ 25 people). I am a director. I was supposed to be an active partner, we argued over the years as I was consistently left on the periphery, I didn't have access to the finances for years, he always gave me an excuse as to why I didn't have replacement bank access details when mine stopped working pre Covid. I regularly asked him how we were doing financially, he sad ""not bad"", ""pretty good"", I checked with him that major creditors had been paid, that pensions had been paid into (they have, I've now checked), every time I knew account submissions to companies house were due I would get assurance after assurance that it was all in hand. Every time there was a letter through our door saying the accounts were late, there was always a reason, always assurances that our accountant was taking care of it. I am a fucking IDIOT for believing him. If I'm honest, I never felt 100% sure deep down. I got myself another job last November, which I love and I've been very successful in so far - it gives me purpose, it gives me a renewed sense of identity and self worth. Thank god for this job. The shit hit the fan on Thursday when our business partner (owns a very small percentage of the business, he's a silent partner for all intents and purposes but listed as a director) got a call from the bank to say that the ltd company had been struck off due to not filing any accounts (even the extension deadline had been exhausted), and that our bounce back loan of circa 22k and the overdraft that he had managed to run up since the last accounts were filed of 20k were both immediately due in full. After all my pleas for involvement, information, offers of help and support ad infinitum (even after I started the new job), reassurances from him that all is well, we are now in a position that we may well have to sell our house to pay the debt, and shut a business down that has been running since the 80s (we took it over in 2013). I checked companies house, they have issued no less than 5 compulsory strike-off notices since 2020. I am livid with myself. Covid hit us hard, but that doesn't explain why accounts were submitted late, or not at all in this case. He's submitted a plea in writing to have a final chance to submit the accounts and he's meeting the accountant on Monday (it isn't her fault, she's been sending him emails asking for more information that he's just been ignoring), when they'll complete and file them if they can - in the vain hope that this will appease the Companies House gods. He is saying all the right things, ""I've fucked up, you deserve better"" etc. he is telling me he has been depressed for a while, and I know depression takes many forms but all I've see him do over the past year is having fun with his mates, playing in his band, spending inordinate amounts of time on frivolous projects - which I thought he was doing as he was on top of the business stuff. He's been working from home about 90% of the time since Covid (I don't work from home), but unless I ask him to do something specific in the house it usually doesn't get done. Often the breakfast stuff is still on the table when I get home. Our lovely house is currently a shithole - it doesn't help that I'm currently anaemic so when I get home I am dog tired and can only just about make dinner - admittedly he does cook sometimes, and clears up if he doesn't cook, he's pretty good with the kitchen stuff. He has had some shit thrown at him this year by life - he was very ill a few months ago and was hospitalised, which put him out for about a month, his estranged father died (complex grief is a thing, of that I'm sure). He has every reason to be depressed. But he's lied and he's lied and he's lied. He's jeopardised us, our house, the livelihoods of 25 people, our friend/business partner and his family (who are godparents to my DD, as I am to theirs), not that I am going to let them financially suffer - this is on us. All because he couldn't say the words, ""I need help"". Why? Because of his pride? I just don't understand. He's crying a lot to me, suggesting we would be better off without him - I told him that suicide would be the most selfish thing he could do to me. Was that cruel? I'm begging him to see someone, to talk to someone - but I've also told him it can't be me right now as I am so so angry and upset. He's currently on a golfing weekend - it was already paid for and to be honest I told him to go, I needed him away from me. It also happens to be an annual memorial golf weekend in memory of his friend that died by suicide. The only thing I feel will help me feel better is to cut myself. I can't call Samaritans, not with my DD upstairs. They don't offer an online chat service yet, does anyone know of a service that does? I think I need to talk to someone.","2023-09-15","143","129297445","2023-09-19","PragmaticWench","Alternatively, please call your local mental health crisis team.

In my early 20's I was a rampant rabbit. Would be up for anything and had many sexual partners where the sex was just AMAZING. I was a borderline nymphomaniac to say that least. Fast forward 7 years, I'm in a LTR with a very loving partner, perfect in every way and I'm very attracted to him. But my vagina says otherwise! I just can't get turned on for the life of me and my libido has hit rock bottom. We've tried everything we can in the book and I'm starting to pull my hair out as to why it's changed in the last couple of years. I dry up immediately and don't feel that 'excitement' when he touches me, sometimes I feel uncomfortable and quite shameful and would rather avoid it. I've heard testosterone can fix the issue? I'm only mid 20's so hoping I'm not doomed! It's really starting to upset me and hoping somehow, this can be fixed.","2023-03-29","16","125014842","2023-03-29","LarryandLeon","How long have you been in the relationship?

Been with my partner 5 years and the sex has never been good. It's been 'ok'. Previous to him I had a high sex drive and spent a lot of time with different flings and short term boyfriends where I thoroughly enjoyed sex so much. Since being with my partner it's just been... shit. He's perfect in every way, apart from sex. He's loving, very handsome, caring, works hard etc but the sexual chemistry is just not there for me. I'm scared to leave, incase I regret it. If I left I could buy him out and own the house but I moved away from home to be in-between both our families and feel if I left, I'd loose everyone I've met through him and fear I'd never meet such a wonderful family as his. I don't want to make a mistake but it's just taking its toll on me now. We haven't had sex for two months because I just can't stand it. I feel sick and disgusting afterwards and it simply isn't normal. Any advice?","2023-03-28","42","125004840","2023-03-28","LakeTiticaca","This was me 40+ years ago as a naive 20 year old . My first proper relationship I really fell for him. Sex was great. We decided to move in together and unfortunately on our very first night in our crummy rented bedsit, I got the ick. I couldn't stand him touching me. I naively thought it would improve but it didn't and I spent 2 years in utter misery, avoiding sex and being called frigid. Thankfully it ended and I was finally free. You need to end things because it won't change. It's kinder that way for both of you x"

When we met I didn't fall deeply in love, it grew to a stable love over time. I'd had a string of bad relationships and thought I was making a grown up choice. I told myself that sparks and head over heels was a fairy tale. Only, now I'm here at 47 with a 9 year old DS and I'm not particularly happy in the relationship. I'm not deeply unhappy, my DH is a good man but we've become more like co-parents who very occasionally have sex. I spend a lot of time doing my own thing and avoiding too much time with him. His habits annoy me and I'm sure he'd the same about me! I care about him, he's one of my closest friends.. but I keep thinking does he deserve a better love than I give him and vice versa? Or do I just need to grow the F up? Work on myself and my issues? This feels like a diamond shoes too tight kind of problem to be honest. Marriages exist on less.

She was telling me that she picks and chooses her shifts through an agency but that she is self-employed. Okay, fine. But I made a comment about tax self assessment and asked if it were much of a pain. The nurse told me that she set up a limited company to pay herself. What's the benefit? Google suggests no NICs (not necessarily a benefit I think - no state pension?) and that company tax rates are lower than personal tax rates. Is that why or are there other benefits? It sounds a little too easy or is she very savvy? I didn't have time to ask her as we were needed elsewhere. I'm NHS staff and don't plan to change, not at the moment anyway. But I was surprised she went to the effort of a ltd co.","2024-01-12","10","132182173","2024-01-13","Hereyago","And don’t forget corporation tax! A lot of people think limited companies pay a lot less tax but they pay 19% on all profit (and that’s increasing). I would expect that as a nurse, she would have loads of ‘expenses’ so will have to pay this. It actually works out as more tax in certain cases."

I was strongly tempted by Less GGP (Grey Gables Peril) More GPP (Guinea Pig Plot) , which was a plaintive cry from @PuppyPerson some days ago, but if Poppy has found new homes for the baby guinea pigs that may be the last we hear of them for some time, sadly. Surely in the life of the next thread we must hear more from or of Rob, or Ron as some on this thread prefer to call him? <taps foot> Will Kirsty snap and tell Helen a few home truths? Will Pat's shotgun finally be brought into play? We can only hope ... Also, will we ever find out who owns the other 60% of Grey Gables?
